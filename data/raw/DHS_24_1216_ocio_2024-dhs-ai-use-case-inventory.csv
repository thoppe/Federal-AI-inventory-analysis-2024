Leveraging this intelligent retrieval technology does not rely on extensive application changes and offers substantial benefits in providing round-the-clock support while prioritizing complex inquiries. This initiative aims to enhance survivor satisfaction and call center efficiency by reducing call handle times and maintaining or improving answer quality.  The current applications for handling agent inquiries for processing applications are resource-intensive, leading to high operational costs and inefficiencies, especially during peak periods immediately following presidential-declared disasters. Currently, FEMA has a repository on SharePoint called the Processing Procedures Manual (PPM) that houses more than 70 documents that make up over 2,000 pages worth of content and guidance. Agents search this content and guidance with find function and keyword search, first having to find the right document, and then using keyword-based search and find functionality, negatively impacting efficiency and quality and leading to increases in escalations to higher tiers of agents/support who are no longer freed up to work on more complex situations.  Implementation of a 24/7 digital, interactive application will expedite guidance comprehension and discovery to provide better support to disaster survivors during active disasters. The system would use AI and search capabilities to intelligently analyze FEMA policies and guidance and assist the agents through the assistance review and award process.  

The AI will enable agents to retrieve information quickly, reducing the overall time spent on each call.  By providing more accurate and relevant search results, the AI will help agents deliver consistent, correct responses.  Reducing the time spent per call will improve operational efficiency, leading to potential cost savings.  By empowering agents with the correct information, the tool will lower the frequency of escalations to supervisors, allowing them to focus on more complex cases.  The time saved through the AI tool will allow agents to handle more complex queries, ultimately improving service quality and survivor satisfaction.

Supervised learning models include sample statistics, generalized linear models, decision trees, and deep neural networks. 

The purpose of these supervised learning models is for informational purposes, to produce predictions for to-be-determined quantities of interest and for decisional purposes that may include implicit use (e.g., seeing a large number of households requiring assistance may motivate FEMA Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to consider requesting additional funding for the Disaster Relief Fund) or explicit use (e.g., the number of estimated housing units required may be used to determine the number of housing units to order just-in-time). Anticipated benefits of using supervised learning models include increased predictive performance, timely predictions, quantification of uncertainty, and rigor. 

These supervised learning models produce predictions, not recommendations or decisions (though they can inform human users in making recommendations and decisions). At minimum, these models will produce point predictions for the different quantities of interest for disaster declarations. Additionally, they may produce prediction intervals or predictive distributions as feasible and appropriate for the given prediction problem.

DHS-2424,DHS,ICE,AI Assisted Compromise Email Detector (AACED),"The AI Assisted Compromise Email Detector (AACED) helps prioritize which emails human security analysts should investigate first to identify cyber compromise ICE. This use case reports AI-enabled analysis on a one-time export of emails between ICE and Microsoft relevant to Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Emergency Directive 24-02. This use case does not perform live email analysis and only includes emails sent to/from ICE email accounts. 

The Information Assurance Division (IAD) within ICE is responsible for providing Cybersecurity Services to ICE, including operating the ICE Security Operations and Computer Security Incident Response Center through its Cyber Defense & Intelligence Branch. The Branch performs information assurance mitigation, responds to (and reports on) Information Technology (IT) security incidents, performs systems vulnerability testing, and monitors and evaluates the security performance on sensitive enterprise systems. CISA published Emergency Directive (ED) 24-02: Mitigating the Significant Risk from Nation-State Compromise of Microsoft Corporate Email System in which all Federal Government Agencies were required to review the stored email metadata from Microsoft to determine if they were affected from the breach. This requires the investigation of tens of thousands of emails to determine if there were any signs of compromise or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage. 

The use case was developed to assist ICE Security Operations Center (SOC) in reviewing a collection of emails between ICE personnel and Microsoft that were part of ED 24-02.  It provides a faster mechanism for SOC analysts to determine indicators of compromise, reducing the level of effort for these individuals’ analysis exponentially.  To assist the analysts, Named Entity Recognition (NER) was used to detect PII and other associated keywords while a locally running Large Language Model (LLM), with no external connections, answers questions about selected emails.  The LLM also answers preset questions formulated from Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). The analysts use the outputs to expedite the detection of PII and key language within emails, reducing the time needed to analyze the total collection of emails.  If the use case detects PII or key language, then those emails are ranked as higher risk and prioritized by the analyst. The analyst then inspects the email at that location for presence of the data and logs it manually allowing for specified actions based on the results of the analysts’ review.  Ultimately, all emails are manually inspected and depending on the circumstance of the investigation the ICE Privacy Office may be contacted notifying them of the PII that was exposed, or the analyst will provide the information to the SOC Leadership to initiate the incident response process to perform remediation actions needed.  The use case only provides ranking for prioritized processing to the SOC analysts.

DHS-407,DHS,ICE,Biometric Check-in for ATD-ISAP (SmartLINK),"The Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP) Monitoring App includes unique facial verification technology that allows participants to capture their photo during ICE Alternatives to Detention (ATD) enrollment for future verification purposes (e.g., during check-in). Unlike facial identification or recognition, the facial verification function uses a one-to-one matching approach of the individual presenting to the Monitoring App during their check-in by comparing it against the ATD participant’s photograph captured upon enrollment to determine whether the person is who they declare themselves to be. The Monitoring App can be launched from either an ICE ATD-issued mobile device or from the participant’s personal mobile device.  It takes a series of photos of the participant during enrollment, which are stored in the ISAP ATD case management system. During subsequently checks in, an automatic 1:1 verification image of the individual in front of the phone’s camera is matched against the stored profile images to enable the ICE ATD Case Manager to verify the participant’s identity, using a proprietary algorithm. The technology also recognizes if a “live” person is in front of the camera, as opposed to a representation or image of a person. There is a visual ICE ATD Case Manager review if there is no match or if the matching attempt generates an error alert. The photos are only used for the described verification purpose and are not shared for any other purpose or with any other entity or database. Any pictures taken during the facial template capture are immediately deleted from the device and only the facial measurements are captured. 

The ISAP Biometric Monitoring App is a technology option that allows participants to report in using a smartphone.

Once individuals are in the ATD-ISAP program, officers periodically perform case reviews to determine if current levels of case management and technology assignment are appropriate for the noncitizen in the program or if they need to be adjusted. During the case review, the officer will consider numerous factors to include, but not limited to, current immigration status, supervision and compliance history, pending benefits, being a care giver or care provider, current immigration stage, pending criminal history and/or convictions, the hurricane score, and other factors. The factor known as the Hurricane Score is a quasi-binomial, binary classification machine learning (ML) model that is given information by an analyst that is known about an individual (factors from case management details and participant actions) and determines the probability that the individual will abscond based on absconding patterns the model has learned from inactive ATD-ISAP case data. The model returns a score from 1-5, with the higher number equating to a higher risk. The officer may use this score as one of the many factors previously described when deciding the appropriate level of case management and technology for noncitizens enrolled in the ATD-ISAP program. Because the hurricane score can quickly evaluate an enormous amount of information on thousands of noncitizens in the ATD-ISAP program, it provides officers with additional insight that they would not have otherwise had when performing a case review. ",Active,Operation and Maintenance,Law & Justice,,No,No,"The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) division would like to explore technology that could help lead to time savings and eliminate human error due to overburdened officers.

The hurricane score may be one factor that is used to inform the decision-making process. The “Hurricane Score” models the potential risk (1-5) that a noncitizen who is released from detention with the requirement to check in with ICE through monitoring will abscond from the program, with a higher number indicating a higher risk of absconding.","The Hurricane score model determines a probability of absconding and outputs a number (1-5), with a higher number indicating a higher risk of absconding.

HSI’s mission is to protect the United States from transnational crime and terrorism by disrupting organizations involved in human trafficking, narcotics smuggling, cybercrime, and other illicit activities. HSI relies on advanced technologies to analyze and process vast amounts of data, including audio and video evidence. Effective investigations depend on the ability to extract relevant information quickly and accurately from large volumes of unstructured reports. Traditional lexical search methods often fall short in this regard. Semantic Search and Summarization technology bridges this gap by leveraging large language models (LLM) to allow investigators to submit natural language queries.  These queries are analyzed to identify the most relevant information in reports, accelerating investigative analysis by rapidly identifying persons of interest, surfacing trends, and detecting networks or fraud. Furthermore, the system allows investigators to build reports by entering raw notes and leveraging LLM to generate a draft report that adheres to the Report of Investigation (ROI) manual's formatting and style guidelines. This saves time and produces more articulate and accurate reports. Once reviewed, validated, and approved by supervisors, the final report is uploaded to a case management system.

DHS-178,DHS,USCG,Adaptive Risk Model for Inspected Small Passenger Vessels,"This AI system helps the USCG assign a numerical risk score for Small Passenger Vessels (SPV) relative to one another. The SPV Safety Task Force leveraged machine learning (ML) and subject matter expert (SME) input to create an adaptable, quantitative analysis tool that reliably identifies the key drivers of marine casualties and calculates a risk score for each vessel within the largest segment of the U.S.-inspected fleet. A vessel risk score is computed with an analytic model that leverages logistic regression and basic ML. The risk score is then combined with an SME-derived consequence score that considers the number of vessel passengers and operation distance from shore. The final combined number is used to categorize a vessel into one of three tiers: at the lowest risk tier, vessels will receive, at a minimum, mandated inspections as per Title 46 Code of Federal Regulations, while vessels in tiers 2 and 1 may receive more frequent or more thorough inspections by more experienced inspectors. Before an inspection recommendation is communicated to the vessel owner, an SME reviews and approves the vessel scores. Follow-on policy efforts set the required scope and frequency of inspection, the minimum competency of the lead inspector, and the level of accountability for each vessel. In addition to their modeling and policy efforts, this team conducted extensive education and outreach with the field, district, and area commands to aid adoption and foster implementation.

DHS-180,DHS,USCIS,Automated Name and Date of Birth (DOB) Harvesting from Existing Records,"Automated Name and Date of Birth (DOB) Harvesting is being developed to reduce the amount of adjudicative time spent manually harvesting aliases and DOBs from Identity History Responses (IdHS) text. The use case output draws from FBI Background Check System (BCS) source information and is provided to USCIS officers to consider during case processing. For aliases, this solution uses a named-entity recognition (NER) model trained to understand the specific context around where aliases appear—meaning it’s effective at locating true aliases, while at the same time avoiding other places where proper names may exist but are not aliases (e.g., county or street names). For DOBs, this solution uses pattern matching and conditional logic to harvest valid birth dates, while weeding out obvious placeholders and other non-birth dates found within the IdHS text.  This use case has been in production since 2022 and is enabled only for N400. The solution was developed as a Python library, and the encasing Flask application runs on Amazon EKS. Its primary function is to predict where aliases and dates of birth appear within unstructured IdHS text.  It uses a named-entity recognition (NER) model, trained using Spark NLP with a TensorFlow back end on thousands of systematically labeled IdHS records, and word-level embeddings. 

This use case reduces the amount of adjudicative time spent manually harvesting aliases and dates of birth (DOBs) from identity history summary (IdHS) report attached to the ELIS case as part of the Manual Name Harvesting Task during case processing.

The use case output informs USCIS Verification Account Compliance (VAC) analysts' decisions regarding whether a company applying to register on E-Verify is fraudulent and should be referred for investigation. ARGOS searches a multitude of public datasets for information that is then ranked and scored based on text analysis and a risk and fraud model developed in collaboration with the USCIS VAC team. The ARGOS application then displays that information to the end-user, allowing them to view the possibilities of fraud and make an informed decision. The goal of the use case is to streamline the process and accelerate work for the individual who is researching a company that has submitted its information for registration to E-Verify. 

ARGOS sentiment analysis produces a risk score, and keyword extraction identifies the keyword category of interest to the VAC management and program analysts (MPAs) for the aggregated open-source information. This helps quickly identify any pertinent information to aid the MPAs in their open-source investigation of company applications. This process saves potentially thousands of MPA man-hours in open-source investigation and creates a single source of truth for each MPA's investigation of a company application. In turn, this allows for quicker application processing and, if the risk of company fraud exists, much faster referral processing time, expediting the next-step referral to Fraud Detection and National Security (FDNS) for further investigations.

In addition, the FDNS Directorate is responsible for detecting, deterring, and combating immigration benefit fraud.  In 2005, USCIS developed a case management system, the Fraud Detection and National Security-Data System (FDNS-DS), to record, track, and manage the screening processes related to immigration applications, petitions, or requests with suspected or confirmed fraud, public safety, or national security concerns, and to identify vulnerabilities that may compromise the integrity of the legal immigration system.

DHS-189,DHS,USCIS,ELIS Card Photo Validation via myUSCIS,"USCIS uses a system called ELIS to manage immigration requests, and it includes a Photo Validation Service to check if ID photos meet requirements. This helps ensure photos are correct before making ID cards, saving time and avoiding delays. USCIS is the component within DHS that oversees lawful immigration to the United States. USCIS receives immigration requests from individuals seeking immigration and non-immigration benefits. Once a benefit request form is submitted to USCIS, a series of processing and adjudication actions occur. One of the case management systems used to track and adjudicate certain immigration request forms is the Electronic Information System (ELIS). USCIS ELIS is an internal case management system composed of microservices to assist with performing complex adjudicative and processing tasks; one of those microservices is the Photo Validation Service. The card photo validation solution was originally designed for e-filed I-765 (c)(3)s — to be in direct support of the beneficiary as they apply via myUSCIS. In enabling e-filing for the (c)(3)s, one goal was to have everything captured digitally, including these ID photos, all while avoiding any new delays or complications for the applicant in the process. In other words, if we observed an issue with a photo upon upload, we wanted to address it up front — rather than waiting until a failed card production sequence.  Because the photo requirements themselves are fixed, this exact same functionality could also be plugged directly into ELIS, just prior to card production. As of late October 2021, an effort to do exactly this is underway. The primary difference is that an adjudicator would explicitly request that a case’s photo be validated, and if applicable, the service would return a recommendation to edit the photo before submission. 

The photo validation service uses a combination of computer vision techniques and machine learning models to validate photographs and ensure they meet the requirements, so these photographs can be used in card production.

DHS-16,DHS,USCIS,ELIS Evidence Classifier Machine Learning (ML) Tagging Solution,"The Evidence Classifier Service is a machine learning (ML) solution that reduces the time spent by adjudicators and contractors sifting through digital evidence. The solution systematically tags and surfaces critical evidence types for the adjudicators in Electronic Immigration System (ELIS). Until the Evidence Classifier ML solution's introduction, those working on cases and responsible for reviewing evidence documents would often have to sift through dozens, if not hundreds, of unlabeled pages to find one specific artifact. As a result, an ML solution was built to systematically tag individual pages with some of the highest-volume, highest-impact evidence types. 

The service enables end users to navigate directly to the page(s) containing evidence documents of interest, instead of sifting through large PDF documents. Evidence tagging intends to accelerate case processing by identifying specific types of documents (e.g., I-589, passport photo spread, marriage certificate) and applying a metadata tag to that document object in ELIS. When a user opens a case with potentially hundreds of pages of evidence documents they have clickable bookmarks from these tags that will jump directly to the corresponding page.

DHS-61,DHS,USCIS,I-485 Family Matching,"I-485 Family Matching is designed to create models to match family members to underlying I-485 petitions. The underlying immigrant petition defines if the I-485 is employment-based or family-based. It also has information about the visa classification and priority date which, when compared against the Department of State’s monthly Visa Bulletin, helps predict visa usage. It is difficult to match an I-485 to its underlying immigrant petition, because the only available field on which to match is the Alien-number (A-number). This number is not always present on the immigrant petition, and name/date of birth matching is not as reliable.  The goal of I-485 Family Matching is to leverage AI to create connections more confidently between petitioners and their families based on limited data.  Additionally, it was intended to help identify and group I485s filed by family members, as well as gather up the many ancillary forms they may have been pending (such as I765, I131). Similar to immigrant petition matching, it can be difficult to match up I485s filed by family members. In these cases, the only similar fields are a common address. Efforts have been made in the past to identify family members by address, but it is effective only to a point. This use case explored the technical feasibility of using an AI model to help make working with this data more reliable (as well as group individual petitioners, their families, and other helpful associated data together for faster and more accurate processing).

DHS-414,DHS,USCIS,I-765 - USCIS Face Capture Mobile App,"Utilizing facial capture in the mobile application reduces the burden on both Application Support Centers and customers by providing an alternative method for capturing card-quality photographs used for document production. Application Support Center appointments are limited to work hours, often requiring applicants to take time off work. In some regions, applicants may need to travel long distances to reach an application support center and inclement weather can make attending appointments difficult. The mobile application enables photograph collection without the need for a biometrics appointment, enhancing processing efficiency for adjudicators and offering greater convenience for applicants. This will allow the user to complete the biometric verification requirement without having to attend an appointment at an Applicant Support Center. This reduces the burden on the beneficiary and decreases demands on USCIS Applicant Support Center resources. 

Face detection locates human faces in visual media such as digital images or video. When a face is detected, it has an associated position, size, and orientation; it can also be searched for landmarks such as the eyes and nose, which are returned as numerical values.

DHS-413,DHS,USCIS,I-765 - USCIS Facial Recognition through IDENT (1:1 Face Recognition/Validation),"USCIS intends to leverage facial recognition for several reasons. Multiple court orders require the adjudication of employment authorization applications within 30 days. Currently, applicants must attend an Application Support Center to verify their identity and capture a photograph, which can take up to three weeks of the 30-day period. Using the facial verification service makes this process nearly instant and greatly enhances processing efficiency without compromising the effectiveness of current identity verification methods. Additionally, new rules created by the FBI’s Compact Council require biometric verification to perform fingerprint resubmissions for different filing reasons than the original fingerprint capture. Facial verification brings USCIS into compliance with this rule change. Furthermore, performing facial verification increases the integrity of information and identities by identifying conflicts early on, preventing issues from becoming pervasive across immigration systems. This will allow the user to complete the biometric verification requirement without having to attend an appointment at an Applicant Support Center.

More specifically, IMO is used to derive a single identity across multiple systems for each applicant or beneficiary who interacts with USCIS. USCIS maintains a variety of systems to track specific interactions with individuals – benefits case management, appointment scheduling, background check validation, and customer service inquiries. Each system captures its own person-centric data attributes (e.g., Social Security Number (SSN), Alien number (A-number), name, date of birth (DOB), address, etc.) related to individuals interacting with the agency. The system is designed to handle different data formats and potential data quality issues present in the source data to identify duplicate identities in a data set or between two data sets. The derived identities are linked back to the original source records, enabling USCIS personnel to view an individual's comprehensive interaction history with the agency.

DHS-55,DHS,USCIS,Person-Centric Identity Services Deduplication Model,"The vision of Person-Centric Identity Services (PCIS) is to be the authoritative source of trusted biographical and biometric information that provides real-time, two-way visibility between services into an individual's comprehensive immigration history and status. The de-duplication model ingests person-centric datasets from various source systems for model training and evaluation purposes. Our dataset includes biographic information (e.g., name, date of birth, alien number Social Security Number, passport number) as well as biographic information (e.g., fingerprint IDs, eye color, hair color, height, weight) for model training and matching purposes. Critical to the success of PCIS is the entity resolution and de-deduplication of individual records from various systems of records to create a complete picture of a person. Using machine learning (ML), the model can identify which case management records belong to the same unique individual with a high degree of confidence. This allows PCIS to compile a full immigration history for an individual without the need for time-consuming research across multiple disparate systems. The de-duplication model plays a critical role in the entity resolution and surfacing of a person and all their associated records. The ML models are more resilient to fuzzy matches and handle varying data fill rates more reliably. 

Using Machine Learning allows us to improve entity resolution as compared to rule-based system. PCIS offers the ability to see a person's immigration history organized in one place. Specific benefits do or will include: an organized summary view of the identity with the individual's latest photo from PCIS; full immigration history including receipts associated with the applicant, regardless of case management system; mailing, physical, and safe history of the individual organized in reverse chronological order, allowing users to easily find the most recent address; all identifiers associated with the applicant, including Alien number, Social Security Number, passport number, etc.; and a numerical likelihood score which is used to determine if the record belongs to the individual, subjected to a high threshold (.98, maximum 1) to assess whether the record belongs to the individual.

DHS-130,DHS,USCIS,Text Analytics Data Science Sentence Similarity Model,"USCIS oversees lawful immigration to the United States. Through its Refugee, Asylum & International Operations Directorate (RAIO), USCIS administers programs to provide protection to qualified individuals who have suffered past persecution or have a well-founded fear of future persecution in their country of origin, as outlined in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.). The Text Analytics capability employs machine learning and data graphing techniques to identify patterns that may indicate potential fraud, national security, and/or public safety concerns by scanning the digitized narrative sections of the associated applications and looking for common language patterns. The Text Analytics Data Science Sentence Similarity Model identifies similarity and relevancy in text to determine potential matches in documents submitted into the system. Text Analytics does not make any determinations or decisions but is instead utilized as a research tool by staff in the course of their duties. 

Text Analytics augments the tedious and time-consuming manual process of identifying potential fraud, national security, and/or public safety concerns and enables the identification of such concerns across jurisdictional boundaries. It increases the integrity of immigration programs, strengthens officers’ confidence in their work, and contributes to the reduction in customer wait times. 

Text Analytics does not make predictions, recommendations, or decisions.

DHS-20,DHS,USCIS,Timeseries Analysis and Forecasting,"USCIS is the component within DHS that oversees lawful immigration to the United States. That means USCIS receives, processes, and maintains all applications for admission for Lawful permanent residents (LPRs), or adjustments to LPR status. Also known as “green card” holders, LPRs are non-citizens who are lawfully authorized to live permanently within the United States and are required to fill out Form I-90, Application to Replace Permanent Resident Card (Green Card). Since there has been a considerable influx of green card applications, USCIS used a combination of exploratory data analysis to determine the most used categories for applicants submitting I-90's and machine learning to create predictions of workloads. As a follow-on, USCIS used Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models on the I-90 form, which allowed the prediction of the total number of forms for a 2-year period. ARIMA is one of the easiest and effective machine learning algorithms to perform time series forecasting. This capability has been deployed in production for more than a year.

DHS-2305,DHS,USCIS,USCIS Translation Service,"USCIS is testing AI-powered tools to quickly and accurately translate documents and provide real-time interpretation, enhancing communication and processing for immigration services. The USCIS Translation Service assesses the effectiveness and security of GenAI-powered translation tools for document translation and real-time interpretation. AI and GenAI models trained on relevant subjects (e.g., immigration law, visa applications, family/adoption certificates) provide fast, accurate translation of written or other digital documents in various languages. AI and GenAI-powered speech-to-speech and speech-to-text translation tools enable efficient communication, consultations, and other interactions within DHS. Supporting language translation and transcription is crucial for operations and adjudications across all DHS components. One use case application involves United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) document translation, a time-consuming task for Resettlement Support Center (RSC) caseworkers before USCIS interviews. Documents include passports, national identifications, birth certificates, and more complex documents. The goal is to reduce or eliminate RSC casework dedicated to document collection, translation, data extraction, and summarization by leveraging document translation services. This allows USCIS officers to translate documents ad hoc during interviews.  

USCIS Translation Service use case addresses 4 key problem areas: 1) Limited capacity: Traditional translation methods rely on a finite pool of human translators, causing bottlenecks and delays. 2) Accuracy variability: Consistency and nuance can vary with individual translator expertise, especially with the diversity of languages in the Western Hemisphere and at the Southern Border.

DHS-372,DHS,USCIS,User Entity and Behavior Analytics (UEBA) for Security Operations (SecOps) Anomaly Identification,"User Entity and Behavior Analytics (UEBA) assists USCIS Security Operations (SecOps) in identifying behavioral anomalies that most likely indicate malicious intent or heightened risk associated with user identities and endpoint hosts accessing the USCIS network. The analytics provide risk scoring, which helps USCIS SecOps to prioritize highest risk incidents first. The tool identifies credential compromise, risky behavior, violations of the rules of behavior, and other user behavior anomalies that could indicate the presence of an advanced persistent threat. UBEA is enhanced by machine learning models that can adapt to its environment and identify relevant threats, thereby improving the productivity of the USCIS Security Operations Center (SOC). 

UEBA reviews USCIS system logs to determine when an entity, such as a workstation, server, or internal USCIS system account, is performing actions that are anomalous.  The UEBA ingests logs from systems to perform analytics based on manually created and maintained models. These models  apply a risk score to the entity, which is then used to create a case (or ticket) for SecOps analyst to review.

DHS-2384,DHS,USCIS,Verification Match Model,"The Verification Match Model utilizes machine learning (ML) to gather information from multiple systems and match it to known records by comparing names, dates of birth, and other identifiers. This supports two key USCIS Verification Division (VER) programs: the Employment Verification Program (E-Verify) and the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program.  The model streamlines verification data integration services by providing a ranked order of the best matches, expressed as confidence scores, between the identifiers used by the two programs. These improved matches increase the accuracy of E-Verify and SAVE, ensuring they use the most recent and accurate documents to determine benefit status. E-Verify handles approximately 250,000 requests per day and SAVE handles approximately 70,000 requests per day. Multiple data verification models for SAVE and E-Verify exist, complicating efficiency and performance. By consolidating these into a single, unified Verification Match Model within a separate microservice, the use case aims to improve the accuracy of responses and reduce the need for manual review. ML plays a key role in the continuous improvement of these models, ultimately reducing the need for manual case reviews. 

Leveraging AI in the USCIS verification matching process of known records across systems is beneficial because it streamlines existing USCIS reviews by 1) improving system accuracy, 2) reducing human error through automated person-and-record match scoring, and 3) handling a higher volume of matches than traditional tools or manual processes can achieve.
