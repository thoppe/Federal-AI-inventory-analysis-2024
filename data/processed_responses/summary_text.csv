DHS-2386,Sentiment Analysis -FOD Field Offices Complaints and Reviews,"The Sentiment Analysis project for FOD Field Offices focuses on evaluating feedback received by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to identify positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The analysis is presented through an Excel dashboard that categorizes survey results, accompanied by a graph created in Databricks to visualize sentiment distribution, aiding in the enhancement of customer service without offering specific recommendations or decisions."
DHS-231,Testing Performance of ML Model using H2O,"The project focused on testing the performance of a machine learning model using the H2O platform. However, it is no longer an active use case, and further details can be found in the ""Summary of Use Case"" section."
DHS-130,Text Analytics Data Science Sentence Similarity Model,"The Text Analytics Data Science Sentence Similarity Model enhances the identification of potential fraud, national security, and public safety concerns across jurisdictions, improving the efficiency and integrity of immigration programs. It serves as a research tool that detects patterns without making predictions or decisions, allowing trained staff to evaluate and validate such patterns for potential concerns. This approach ultimately strengthens officers' confidence in their work and reduces customer wait times."
DHS-20,Timeseries Analysis and Forecasting,"The Timeseries Analysis and Forecasting project is no longer an active use case. Details can be found in the ""Summary of Use Case"" section."
DHS-63,Topic Modeling on Request For Evidence (RFE) Data Sets,"The project involved topic modeling on Request For Evidence (RFE) data sets, aimed at extracting and analyzing key themes within the data. It is currently marked as inactive, indicating that further activities in this area have ceased."
DHS-365,USCIS  Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) Facial Recognition (FR) On Demand Report (VISA Only),"The USCIS Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) Facial Recognition On Demand Report focuses on visa-related applications and is managed by the Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs. The Department of Homeland Security collaborates with the Department of State to address associated risks and implement mitigation strategies. For further details on this initiative, users are encouraged to consult the Bureau of Consular Affairs."
DHS-2305,USCIS Translation Service,The USCIS Translation Service project aims to enhance document translation and real-time interpretation for immigration-related materials by integrating AI and GenAI models tailored to relevant subject matters. This initiative focuses on providing fast and accurate translations of written documents and facilitating efficient communication through advanced speech translation tools within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The overall goal is to support operations and adjudications across all DHS components by addressing language translation and transcription needs.
DHS-372,User Entity and Behavior Analytics (UEBA) for Security Operations (SecOps) Anomaly Identification,"User Entity and Behavior Analytics (UEBA) for Security Operations focuses on analyzing USCIS system logs to identify anomalous actions by various entities, including workstations, servers, and internal accounts. The system ingests logs and applies manually created models to generate risk scores, which are then utilized to create cases for Security Operations analyst review. This process not only assists in prioritizing cyber events for investigation but also allows for continuous improvement of risk scoring through machine learning feedback."
DHS-2384,Verification Match Model,"The Verification Match Model utilizes AI to enhance the USCIS verification matching process by improving system accuracy, minimizing human error through automated match scoring, and increasing matching capacity beyond traditional methods. This model provides a recommendation score reflecting person-and-record match probability, thereby optimizing the performance of E-verify and SAVE systems for more accurate initial responses."
DHS-415,Criminal Investigations (OBIM),"The Criminal Investigations AI project enables USSS INV personnel to submit photographs or video stills to other government agencies for facial recognition comparisons against their image galleries. This process aids in generating investigative leads to identify victims or suspects by providing potential matches from known individuals. Additionally, personnel can request one-to-one comparisons of specific images for further investigation."
