It evaluates the nurse's performance against the standards, reports on positive findings, identifies weak areas, provides an estimated rating, and grade assessment.  The interactive GPT allows nurses to have a dialog to better understand how their practice can be improved.   Many of our 90,000+ RNs are not proficient in understanding the standards nor adept in writing performance reports. This leads to end-user frustration, quality issues with content, submission gaps compared to the standard, interrater reliability variances, and a host of other challenges with the our current process. The tool aids the nurses in developing the content for their ePerformance submission.  No PHI is allowed in nursing proficiencies (by standard), and PHII is scrubbed prior to submission by the nurse.

The FDA cleared this commercial product in April 2021.
The device physically connects to existing endoscopes, video processors, and display monitors, but does not connect to the VA network.
During endoscopy, the CADe device automatically detects, and highlights suspected neoplastic lesions / polyps in real time. The module was trained and validated with white-light endoscopy videos and continues to be refined with growing datasets. Information about the indications, safety and warnings can be found here: GI Genius™ Intelligent Endoscopy Module - Indications, Safety, and Warnings | Medtronic (https://www.medtronic.com/covidien/en-us/products/gastrointestinal-artificial-intelligence/gi-genius-intelligent-endoscopy/indications-safety-warnings.html)
Multiple studies and meta-analyses have found these devices increase adenoma detection rates, a well-established metric for colonoscopy quality that is related to colon cancer incidence and death. Initial randomized implementation of the devices across VA facilities allowed for a pragmatic evaluation of the impact of these devices on adenoma detection. The evaluation demonstrated that the provision of colonoscopy CADe devices resulted in a statistically significant 21% increase in the odds of adenoma detection and an absolute increase in ADR of approximately 4% compared to colonoscopy without CADe. These devices will improve ADR, which should decrease colorectal cancer incidence and mortality amongst Veterans over time.

VA-4152,Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation (STORM) predictive model ,VA,VHA: Veterans Health Administration,Health & Medical,,None of the Above,"The STORM model is a predictive model to estimate risk of a suicide or overdose-related health care event or death in the next year.  The model uses patient level predictors extracted from the patient’s medical records (into the VA’s Corporate Data Warehouse), such as diagnoses, prescriptions, and health care utilization, etc.  
This predictive model is used for three purposes. (1) Primary use case is to identify patients at elevated risk of suicide or overdose-related events for referral to an interdisciplinary team for clinical case review.  This team makes treatment recommendations to share with treating providers and documents them in the medical record. The STORM algorithm is used to identify patients to refer to this program at each facility.  Assignment to this case management program has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in patients estimated at “very high” risk on the STORM predictive model by 22% in the next 4 months. (2) Secondary use case is to help risk stratify patients based on prior health care interactions to support augmentation of risk mitigation interventions and treatments for patients with patterns of care associated with risk of suicide or overdose events. Risk estimates are provided as a sorting/filtering and informational feature on the STORM clinical decision support system.  This decision support system enables population management of patients prescribed opioids or with opioid use disorders, as well as providing curated information to support treatment planning for individual patients. (3) The last use case is to meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act (CARA) mandating that clinicians use VA decision support tools to review patient risks prior to initiating opioid therapy for pain.  Direct synchronized links from the VISTA medical record to the STORM report integrate this decision support summary information into clinician workflows as a support for risk assessment before writing and initial opioid prescription.  Each of these use cases is built into existing clinical workflows completed by overlapping, but different health care providers. For use case 1, designated interdisciplinary risk review teams at each health care system use the risk estimates to determine which patient require risk review.  For use case 2, VA health care providers (e.g., opioid prescribers) and teams (e.g., primary care and general mental health teams) use the risk estimates in combination with decision support recommendations of interventions to consider facilitate and augment risk assessment and treatment planning for their patients on opioid analgesics or being treated for opioid use disorder.  For use case 3, VA medication prescribers or their delegated team members use the categorized risk scores in the context of curated descriptive data from the patient’s medical record to review risk factors and consider risk and benefits of treatment options for pain management before prescribing opioids.  Risk considerations are documented in a clinical note for tracking.   Use of STORM is expected to improve decision-making about opioid prescribing and treatment of patients with opioid use disorders, as well as consistency of use of clinical practice guideline recommended treatment practices for safe management of patients exposed to opioids.  STORM also focuses on ensuring recognition of patient risks and facilitating care coordination across treatment providers for complex patients with multiple interacting disorders. By improving use of risk mitigation practices and treatment interventions, we expect STORM will reduce adverse outcomes for patients exposed to opioids.  Program evaluations support this expectation, finding that implementation of the targeted interdisciplinary review requirements associated with use case 1 significantly reduced all cause mortality in the targeted patient population.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10698768/","The STORM predictive model estimates the risk of having an overdose or suicide-related event in next year for all patients currently receiving a VA opioid analgesic prescription with nightly updates.  For all other active VHA patients, the STORM predictive model estimates the hypothetical risk of having an overdose or suicide-related event in next year, if the patient was prescribed or otherwise had access to low, medium, or high dose opioid analgesics.  These risk estimates are provided to clinicians on a family of dashboards, both as percentage likelihood of an event in the next year, and as a categorical grouping of estimated low, medium, high or very high risk.   Paired with this risk estimate is a summary of all risk factors identified and considered in generating the risk estimate for that patient, and recommendations for risk mitigation and treatment options to consider.  These recommendations are tailored based on patient characteristics identified in the medical record (e.g. Medications for opioid use disorder are recommended for patients seen for an opioid use disorder diagnosis) and patient receipt of these interventions is tracked and displayed on the dashboard.  The STORM dashboards are used by clinicians as an informational tool to summarize and organize medical record information to support risk reviews during treatment planning (e.g. when considering an opioid prescription), for management of patients prescribed opioids or treated for opioid use disorder, and for interdisciplinary case reviews of very high risk patients to ensure safe and effective care coordination and treatment planning across health care providers.",Operation and Maintenance,Both

VA-4193,Deep-Learning approaches to develop candidate lists of terms for use in text searches ,VA,VHA: Veterans Health Administration,Health & Medical,,None of the Above,"The intended use is to increase the comprehensiveness of term lists to be used in text-matching approaches to identifying concepts of interest in free-text medical record notes. Text-matching approaches are an efficient method for identifying text of interest in medical notes.  The success of text-matching approaches depends on the quality of term lists used to search for a concept of interest.  While humans can generate word lists for text-matching approaches, the generated word lists are likely to be limited and biased by the vocabulary, language habits, population exposure, and local dialects of the human generating the list.  Deep learning methods can help to augment candidate term lists to help overcome some of these challenges.  Once generated these augmented candidate terms are reviewed by subject matter experts for appropriateness and accuracy of the suggested terms for the concept and use case of interest.  Here we (1) query pre-trained large language models (e.g., ChatGPT or Llama) through a user interface that allows prompting (such as the OpenAI API or CodeLlama) and/or (2) query word and phrase “embedding” models (e.g., Word2Vec and Phrase2Vec) to expand candidate term lists for review by subject matter experts.  Our team has found both approaches effective for expediting the generation of more comprehensive term to concept mappings for use in text-matching algorithms that increase the accuracy of clinical concept extraction.   We expect this use of AI to improve initial brainstorming of terms related to a given concept, resulting in a more sensitive approach to finding information of interest in free-text clinical notes. ","The outputs of this use of AI is a candidate list of terms related to a concept of interest.  This candidate list is combined with suggestions generated by human experts and then these are reviewed by a subject matter expert to generate a final list of terms for use in text-matching algorithms to extract medical record free text mentions of interest. For the pre-trained Large Language model approach, the input is a query prompting for synonyms of terms related to the concept of interest.  The output is the answer provided by the LLM, including the suggested candidate terms and the original terms that were stated in the query.  For the word and phrase embedding models, the input is an initial list of terms that are relevant to the concept of interest and the output are the suggested candidate terms, ranked by their statistical similarity to the original terms, based on the transformation of a clinical corpus into vector space or an “embedding model”.  Regardless of the type of model used, all suggested candidate terms are reviewed by subject matter experts to ensure quality term lists are used in all text searches.",Operation and Maintenance,Neither

VA-4234,Recovery Engagement and Coordination for Health – Veterans Enhanced Treatment (REACH VET) 1.0 predictive model,VA,VHA: Veterans Health Administration,Health & Medical,,None of the Above,"The REACH VET 1.0 model is a predictive model using predictors extracted from the patient’s medical records (into the VA’s Corporate Data Warehouse), such as diagnoses, prescriptions, and health care utilization, to estimate statistical risk of a suicide death in the next month.  
This predictive model is used for two purposes. (1) Primary use case is to support identification of patients at elevated statistical risk of suicide in the next month for referral to a clinical case review and outreach program. Staffing guidance to ensure each health care system is staffed to conduct the case review and outreach protocol is established per clinical policy. To date, the population recommended to the clinical case review program has been limited to a number equivalent to 0.1% of the total treated patient population at each facility each month; the number of patients in the program may be modified based on guidance from the Office of Suicide Prevention. The REACH VET 1.0 statistical risk estimates contribute to an algorithm used to identify patients to refer to this program at each facility. (2) Secondary use case is to help risk stratify patients based on prior health care interactions to support augmentation of clinical attention and interventions for patients with patterns of care associated with high suicide risk. This is used, for example, to support clinical review of relevant health care history during triage of Veteran Crisis Line calls and during risk assessment of patients in mental health care.
For use case 1, REACH VET coordinators and REACH VET providers use the list and supporting information to guide execution of the targeted prevention program. For use case 2, Veterans Crisis Line responders and VHA health care providers use the categorized risk scores in the context of curated descriptive data from the patient’s medical record to review risk factors towards optimizing assessment and clinical follow-up.   
The REACH VET 1.0 model is expected to identify a population of patients at elevated risk of suicide and other negative outcomes for review by clinicians; clinicians conduct telephone outreach to identified patients when they deem such outreach appropriate.  This model and targeted prevention in which it is used (i.e. the REACH VET program) is used to augment VHA's extensive clinical suicide prevention program. While VHA conducts universal screening for suicide risk by asking patients structured questions regarding suicidality, this screening process does not identify all patients who go on to die of  suicide. The REACH VET model is intended to identify patients who might be missed in clinical assessment or whose risk may have changed since their last assessment. Here, the REACH VET model identifies patients at statistical risk of suicide, that is they share similarities in their health care data to patients who did die of suicide in the past.  The patients at highest statistical risk are highlighted to mental health providers for additional review. This targeted prevention program has been nationally implemented in VHA health care systems since 2017 and an evaluation of the effects of the REACHVET program was conducted. This evaluation found that REACH VET implementation was associated with greater treatment engagement and new safety plan documentation and fewer mental health admissions, emergency department visits, and suicide attempts. Full findings of this program evaluation are available at:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8524305/","The REACH VET predictive model estimates the likelihood of dying of suicide in the next month for each active patient in VHA. This estimate is used as part of an algorithm that considers factors such as the size of the health care system, current patient treatment engagement, and whether the patient has had previous engagement with the REACH VET program to generate a dashboard with patients at high statistical risk of suicide for review by a REACH VET coordinator and identified clinicians at each health care system. The REACH VET dashboard provides information about identified risk factors for the included patients and supports a coordinated case review and, where applicable, clinical outreach process to support identification of care gaps and offer additional services as appropriate.",Operation and Maintenance,Both

VA-4439,Using Artificial Intelligence to Predict Suicide,VA,VHA: Veterans Health Administration,Health & Medical,,Searching for information using AI.,"Prevention of Veteran suicide is VHA’s top clinical priority. We use AI to identify patients with two key risk factors for death by suicide: 1) having access to a gun, and 2) having an active opioid use disorder. This project is funded by and developed with input from the Office of Suicide Prevention.

THREE REASONS KNOWING ABOUT ACCESS TO GUNS IS CRITICAL TO SUICIDE PREVENTION
First, when a person attempts suicide using a gun, the death rate is about 85%. For the most common method of attempting suicide—drug overdose—the death rate is less than 5%. Second, Veterans are more likely to own a gun and know better how to use it than other patients, so Veterans’ death rate when attempting suicide using a gun is even higher. Third, there are things clinicians can do to protect Veterans from their guns while they are suicidal, such as counselling them to give the guns or the ammunition to friends or family until they feel better.  This is always voluntary, but Veterans very often agree to it, because they see and fear the risk. 

WHY KNOWING WHICH PATIENTS HAVE ACTIVE OPIOID USE IS CRITICAL TO SUICIDE PREVENTION
Patients who die by suicide almost always have a prior history of emotional and mental health difficulties. When they die by suicide, it’s usually not due to that history, but rather because some bad life event (such as breaking up with their spouse) happens and then they have an overwhelming impulse to end their lives. 

Opioid use disorder (OUD) contributes to suicide risk in two ways. First, it makes bad life events much more common. It’s hard to keep a job or have good relationships with OUD. Second, OUD also increases impulsivity. That is, among patients who have just lost their jobs, those with OUD are more likely to have the impulse to end their lives. (Among substance use disorders, we focus on OUD because it is very common and there are good treatments available.)


WHY USE AI TO DETERMINE ACCESS TO GUNS?
The need for AI arise from how information is stored in an electronic health record. For historical reasons, when a clinician sees a patient, there are codes they can use to record what diseases (e.g., diabetes) the patient has, but there is no code for having access to a gun. VHA has considered asking all patients during intake for each visit whether they have access to a gun, but this is time consuming and can cause concern among patients about why they’re always being asked about guns. 

AI, specifically natural language processing (NLP) of clinical notes, offers another way to know which patients have guns. We have developed NLP algorithms that are very good at assessing from notes whether a patient owns or has access to a gun. But we use only notes already written by clinicians, any mention of gun access came voluntarily from the patient. However, to find this information, we need a method that can go through notes quickly, and NLP provides that method. 

WHY USE AI TO ASSESS WHETHER PATIENTS HAVE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS?
OUD is a disease, and there are disease codes available to record it. However, because there are many different states you can be in with OUD (e.g., actively using vs in rehab vs sober for years), there are over 100 possible ways to code OUD. Most clinical settings (like outpatient clinics and ERs) have short list of commonly used codes for clinicians to pick from, but that may not offer up much specificity. So most clinics will only put on their list a single code, “opioid use, unspecified” and leave off all the more specific codes. Thus, typical coding practice does not differentiate between a patient who is currently using opioids or one who is 10 years sober (and, if you live along time with OUD, it is usually because you spend much of that time sober). That differentiation is important because the increase in impulsivity with OUD is only during active opiate use.

NLP can again be useful, because descriptions of OUD in clinical notes are likely to be much more specific than the codes used","OUR INPUT, OUTPUT, AND INTENDED USER In the “Please add anything else you would like to share” box below we describe in more detail why it is necessary to use AI to find information about gun access or OUD (versus either not having the information or getting that information without using AI). We also describe how we build and test AI models to determine whether a patient has gun access or is actively using opioids. First, however, we think it is important to describe how human clinicians in VHA will use our AI.   The INPUT to our AI models is simply the notes that have already been written on patients. These only contain information volunteered by the patient. The OUTPUT of our models will be simply indicators that a patient **may** have access to a gun or **may** have an active substance use disorder, along with a presentation of the text that leads the AI algorithm to reach its conclusion.   However, the INTENDED USE of the output is that a human mental health clinician be notified about patients at risk, then read the note or notes that led to the determination that the patient was at risk. The clinician may conclude that the AI was incorrect (this occurs about 12-16% of the time with our current models) and drop the issue. Alternatively, the clinician may decide that the patient does have the risk factor and that the risk factor needs to be addressed.   There is no planned interaction between the AI and the patient, nor does the AI make any clinical decisions. Rather, it is a tool to help point clinicians to potentially critical information that they might not otherwise have been aware of.   OUR AI METHOD We begin by creating a list of common terms centered around gun access or OUD. We then pull thousands of pieces of clinical text with these terms in them, and have physicians determine whether the risk factor is present or not. (A term can be present, but the patient can still not have the risk factor in a variety of ways. It could be that “the patient’s brother has a gun” or “the patient has NO gun” or “the patient used to use Fentanyl, but quit”.) The text that has been assessed by physicians is called “labeled data”. We then give our NLP models some of the labeled data, so they can learn what positive and negative examples look like.   For each risk factor, we develop 4 non-neural AI text classification models: random forest, bagging, gradient boosting, and logistic regression with ridge penalization. We also implement two large language models, BioBERT and Bio-ClinicalBERT.   Subsequently, we test each algorithm on other data for which we have (but don’t give the algorithm) the label and ask each algorithm to produce its own labels. We then compare each algorithm’s conclusions to the physicians’ conclusions. That is how we know that our algorithms so far, will be incorrect about 12-16% of the time. Over time, we hope to improve the performance of these algorithms. For example, the large language models are relatively new additions to the AI toolkit and perform better than the non-neural models. We expect further advances over time. However, the current level of accuracy is already higher than many commonly used diagnostic tests, such as mammograms or erythrocyte sedimentation rates.

VA-4513,Classify clinical pathway for cancer patients,VA,VHA: Veterans Health Administration,Health & Medical,,Searching for information using AI.,"The VA National Oncology Program has invested in creating clinical pathways that guide providers to provide high quality evidence-based standard of care treatments to Veterans with cancer. However at this time, it is unclear how many or how often providers are ‘on pathway’ or are concordant with this recommendation. Work will focus on leveraging AI to assess degree of adoption of various pathways. For example:  To assess care quality across the VA in regards to genetic testing in Veterans with prostate cancer, and provide the needed information to engage in quality improvement efforts, the VA NOP proposes to develop, evaluate and implement an informatics workflow that is capable of extracting information regarding whether a Veteran with prostate cancer has been offered access to germline and somatic genetic testing. Work will follow the framework NOP developed to assess germline genetic testing in Veterans with breast cancer in response to the Advances in Mammography and Medical Options (MAMMO) for Veterans Act of 2022. Briefly, Veterans receiving care for prostate cancer in VA will be identified using electronic health information in the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, and their latest relevant clinical notes will be retrieved. Data from VistA CPRS prostate cancer pathway templates will provide a gold standard for developing and evaluating the feasibility of using an open-source generative large language model to determine whether a Veteran has been offered genetic testing according to clinical notes. Earlier work has been successful using zero-shot (or few-shot) prompt development. Model fine tuning can be considered should these approaches fail. Upon achieving acceptable accuracy, the model will then be implemented for near real time determination of access to genetic testing at scale, especially in sites where this information is not available. 
This work will allow assessment of quality of care as it relates to adherence to VA endorsed clinical pathways on genetic testing in Veterans with prostate cancer. It will also facilitate efforts for improving care delivered through identification of sites that can be supported through existing efforts such as the National Tele-oncology Office, or cancer care navigation and tracking initiatives.
