31,Use of Microsoft CoPilot within the M365 Purview Security Suite,Environmental Protection Agency,Office of Mission Support,CAIO@epa.gov,,Mission-Enabling,,None of the Above,"Purview is one of the Agency’s tools to protect our Microsoft cloud data and endpoint devices.  Several potential use cases are possible with the addition of CoPilot into the product which is anticipated in upcoming releases within our GCC tenant.  Our proposed use of AI tools is limited in scope the Agency’s existing security boundary, data and ATO.

The expected benefits are faster answers to common questions about the nature of EPA's security and IT infrastructure environment.  We will be able to more effectively leverage the voluminous amount of data currently collected by Purview, Microsoft Security Center, and Defender agents to make decision in a more expedited fashion.  We will be able to act on results more quickly to help reduce security vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

","a.	Security and infrastructure analysts will be able to use CoPilot to better understand and report on existing security vulnerabilities on Microsoft Windows devices. Purview currently delivers canned reports in our dashboard which shows existing vulnerabilities.  CoPilot can be queried to ask specific questions about the vulnerabilities, such as which computers are impacted and the potential mitigation strategy for specific vulnerabilities.
b.	CoPilot can be used to analyze and report on installed software, reporting on potential vulnerabilities and versions for each package.
c.	CoPilot can describe and summarize Data Loss Prevention (DLP) alerts that require Agency attention and help analysts to understand which types of sensitive data are triggering alerts and to improve our models.
d.	CoPilot can quickly respond to common questions about the environment without writing custom reports:  how many Windows 22H2 computers are in the environment?  How many systems are missing the latest Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) client?  How many computers are still unpatched for the Log4J vulnerability?

32,Use of AI tools within the Agency’s instance of ServiceNow,Environmental Protection Agency,Office of Mission Support,CAIO@epa.gov,,Mission-Enabling,,None of the Above,"ServiceNow is used as the Agency’s primary service desk management system for resolving incidents, problems, change controls, knowledge management, inventory of systems and software including the central Configuration Management Datbase (CMDB).  Employees and IT professionals rely on this platform to obtain service, submit incidents, obtain reports and trends, and plan workloads and priorities to solve problems.  Our proposed use of AI tools is limited in scope the Agency’s existing security boundary, data and Authority to Operate (ATO).  The expected benefits are reduced numbers of service tickets and calls which will have a direct cost reduction.  Help desk and IT professionals throughout the agency will be able to leverage the vast trove of knowledge articles, asset inventory and history of hundreds of thousands of service tickets to find answers to challenging (and common) IT issues facing our workforce.","Several use cases have emerged to leverage ServiceNow's upcoming AI tools for employees to engage with an AI agent to ask technical questions to solve specific technical issues.  

For example:
b.	An employee may ask, how do I reset my password; the answer will provide a written response with steps based on our existing internal knowledge articles and a link to the Agency’s self-service password management page at pss.epa.gov.  This could divert thousands of calls away from service desk agents each year.
c.	A service desk agent may ask, how do I troubleshoot a problem a customer reports with the error message at Windows login, “domain not found.”  The response would be a list of steps both the technician and employee will need to preform to resolve the error.  This will save the technician a significant amount of time to search the ServiceNow knowledge articles, read the contents and relay instructions to the customer.
d.	A manager may ask the AI agent, how many computers in Region 10 require updates to the latest version of Windows 11 23H2?  How many installations of Adobe Acrobat (pro) are installed in HQ?  How many Dell Latitude 5340 computer have expired warranties agency-wide, provide a detailed list including service tags?

The benefits are that scientists will more efficiently identify relevant references for consideration in the development of scientific assessments. ","The machine learning tools support scientists in screening references by providing those references in a ranked order. That ranked order may or may not be based on seed references that are ""on topic"" and/or ""off topic. The screening tools build a model based on what the screener identifies for ""inclusion"" and ""exclusion"". This ranked set of references allows scientists to more quickly identify relevant references. Some of these tools also provide an estimate or recall, or the percentage of relevant references identified.

One important aspect of the hydrologic regime is streamflow duration—the length of time that a stream sustains flowing surface water. Determining streamflow duration class can help support a variety of regulatory and non-regulatory water resource management decisions. This random forest modeling supports prediction of the appropriate streamflow duration classification across a range of geographies.
