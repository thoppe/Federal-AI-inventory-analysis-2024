+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Diplomacy & Trade
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Through this activity, USAID/CPS/OTI's Central America Regional Initiative (CARI)/El Salvador program will support Cristosal's (a human rights organization) efforts to better understand how extortion impacts internal displacement. A highly-qualified research team made up of forensic technicians and specialists, with the required professional certifications to use the ethics data analytics tool, will coordinate with Cristosal to interview 60 families from Panchimalco and other communities that have been internally displaced to research the dynamics of violence and social norms in the communities that have motivated the population to migrate internally. The data analytics tool will eliminate common biases that many surveys encounter in gathering information, which will mitigate collection and analysis errors. The grantee will analyze the data collected to identify the potential utility of early warning systems for IDPs, and how community based responses could support reducing extortion-related violence. The grantee will offer recommendations on how to operationalize their findings through programming.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Interview transcripts
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Retired
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case was retired or began the process of retirement**: 2/1/2022
