+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Other
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Statistical Information about People, Places, and the Economy
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Searching for information using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The current search algorithm on data.census.gov does not support true natural language search and is keyword-based. Leveraging a natural language search interface powered by an LLM that uses a RAG architecture to fetch responses to user queries has the potential to vastly improve the search experience and ensure that users of all backgrounds are able to quickly find the information they are looking for.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The AI system would consist of a natural language (LLM) input that would then use RAG (retrieval augmented generation) to identify an answer to the user's query (either in the form of an actual statistic, a relevant dataset, or relevant filters). Once an answer has been identified, it would be returned to the user via a natural language (LLM) interface.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 10/24/2024
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is missing or not available: No documentation exists regarding maintenance, composition, quality, or intended use of the training and evaluation data.
