_[Department of Health and Human Services](<../3_agency/Department of Health and Human Services.md>)_ (HHS) / OCIO


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Government Services (includes Benefits and Service Delivery)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: ChatGPT is an AI-powered chatbot developed by OpenAI, and it can be integrated with Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing platform. ChatGPT leverages the power of OpenAI's language model to provide natural language understanding and generation capabilities.

Scalability: As an AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT can handle multiple conversations simultaneously, scaling up to meet high demand without the need for additional human resources.
Increased Efficiency: ChatGPT can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up human agents to focus on more complex or value-added activities, improving overall efficiency.

Persona Benefits:
Assist data scientists in data exploration, model prototyping, analysis, collaboration, and accessing relevant knowledge, enhancing their productivity and efficiency.

Assist policy analysts by providing instant insights, answering complex policy-related questions, and facilitating interactive discussions, enabling faster and more informed decision-making. 
Assist in writing large policy documents by providing suggestions, generating coherent content, and offering language refinement, streamlining the writing process and ensuring high-quality outputs.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: At present, HHSGPT is undergoing a pilot phase throughout the entire HHS organization under an IATT.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 9/1/2023
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 9/1/2023
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed in-house.
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: No
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: None
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation has been partially completed
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: HHSGPT
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: Less than 6 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: No
+ **Has the communication been timely**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: None: This use case does not re-use any internally developed tooling or managed infrastructure from any other AI development efforts within the agency.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Limited documentation for review: Some information regarding the model’s performance on specific benchmarks are available or have been shared with specific stakeholders within the agency.
