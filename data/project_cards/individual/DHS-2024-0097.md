## DHS-2024-0097
+ **Title of the AI use case:**: Machine Learning Translation Technology Initiative
+ **Agency responsible for the AI use case:**: Department of Homeland Security
+ **Agency abbreviation:**: DHS
+ **Specific organization(s) within the agency responsible for the AI use case:**: ICE
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: Law & Justice
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: 
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B:**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public:**: The solution will be used to facilitate non-critical communications only. When deployed to production, the solution should not be used alone, absent human quality control, when materials are vital to an individual’s rights or benefits, or when the source materials contain non-literal language (e.g., slang, metaphor), lack clear grammar or structure, contain abbreviations or acronyms, or are overly complex, technical, or wordy. If any interactions indicate the presence of legal or medical issues or a need for greater accuracy, ERO personnel are required to seek additional language assistance via bilingual staff or a professional language line. The solution was first spearheaded by U.S. Coast Guard for maritime usage with the support of DHS Science and Technology Directorate through the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP). ICE ERO received FY22 funding to initiate the proof of concept with the vendors vetted by USCG and DHS S&T through an interagency agreement. Solutions, in the form of mobile phone applications, are being developed under research and development phases and projected to completely meet ERO’s requirements by January 2026.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc:**: The Machine Learning Translation Technology Initiative will offer real-time communication/translation services to assist personnel in providing meaningful access to programs and services for limited English proficient (LEP) noncitizens. AI will be used to provide voice to text, text to voice, and voice to voice translations in at least 21 languages.
ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) is developing a real-time translation tool to assist staff in communicating with noncitizens who have limited English proficiency. This tool, intended for non-critical conversations, will supplement existing language services contracts by providing real-time capabilities during various touch points in the ICE process. ERO personnel, who regularly interact with individuals who speak little or no English, currently rely on professional interpretation and translation services, which can be slow to secure. The new machine learning (ML) solution aims to facilitate informal communication quickly and efficiently. When deployed, it will not be used alone for materials vital to an individual’s rights or benefits, or when the source materials contain non-literal language, lack clear grammar, or are overly complex.  In such cases, ERO personnel must seek additional language assistance via bilingual staff or professional language lines. 

The initiative, first spearheaded by the U.S. Coast Guard for maritime usage with support from the DHS Science and Technology Directorate through the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP), received Fiscal Year 2022 funding for proof of concept. Solutions, in the form of mobile phone applications, are being developed under research and development phases and are projected to meet ERO’s requirements by January 2026. The Machine Learning Translation Technology Initiative will offer real-time communication and translation services, providing voice-to-text, text-to-voice, and voice-to-voice translations in at least 21 languages. This technology will enhance the ability of ICE ERO personnel to provide meaningful access to programs and services for limited English proficient (LEP) noncitizens.
