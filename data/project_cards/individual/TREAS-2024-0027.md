+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Improving the quality of written communications using AI tools.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The purpose of this AI project is to modernize and simplify tax notices for better taxpayer comprehension. The AI accomplishes this by transforming complex tax language into clear, accessible content. The model automates the generation of these revised notices, with human reviewers ensuring accuracy and relevance before dissemination. Anticipated benefits include reduced errors and inquiries, increased taxpayer satisfaction, and improved efficiency in tax administration. The direct impact is clearer communication with taxpayers, who are the primary population affected by this initiative, resulting in easier navigation of their tax obligations.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Rewritten taxpayer notices presented in clear, concise language.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
