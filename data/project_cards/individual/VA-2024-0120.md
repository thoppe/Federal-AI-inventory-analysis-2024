+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Government Services (includes Benefits and Service Delivery)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Inputting large amounts of data from paper forms into a digital system using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The intended purpose of the AI model is to streamline the claims processing workflow by automatically extracting relevant information from patient-filled paper forms and organizing the corresponding scans chronologically. This automation eliminates the tedious task of manually renaming and sorting files, significantly reducing the time staff spend on these activities. The expected benefits include a marked decrease in manual labor hours, leading to lower operational costs and minimizing the need for overtime. Ultimately, this efficiency allows staff to focus more on patient care and other critical tasks, improving overall workflow productivity.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The AI model outputs a renamed version of the original file, moving it to a designated SharePoint folder with the relevant information extracted from the patient form. Additionally, specific columns in the file are updated with data to facilitate easy sorting by dates. This streamlined process ensures quick access to organized claims information and enhances overall efficiency.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Implementation and Assessment
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: BTSSS ID: 713
