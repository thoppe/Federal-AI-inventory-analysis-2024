+ **Title of the AI use case:**: I-765 - USCIS Face Capture Mobile App
+ **Agency responsible for the AI use case:**: Department of Homeland Security
+ **Agency abbreviation:**: DHS
+ **Specific organization(s) within the agency responsible for the AI use case:**: USCIS
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: Law & Justice
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: 
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B:**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public:**: This will allow the user to complete the biometric verification requirement without having to attend an appointment at am Applicant Support Center. This reduces the burden on the beneficiary as well as reducing demands on USCIS Applicant Service Center resources.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc:**: Face detection locates human faces in visual media such as digital images or video. When a face is detected it has an associated position, size, and orientation; and it can be searched for landmarks such as the eyes and nose which are returned as numerical values. 

ELIS Photo Validation service sends response back to user based on the pre-defined quality checks if the uploaded photo meets USCIS requirements. I-765 - USCIS Facial Recognition through IDENT (1:1 Face Recognition/Validation) returns a match or no match response from IDENT.
Utilizing facial capture in the mobile application reduces the burden on both Application Support Centers and customers by providing an alternative method for capturing card-quality photographs used for document production. Application Support Center appointments are limited to work hours, often requiring applicants to take time off work. In some regions, applicants may need to travel long distances to reach an application support center and inclement weather can make attending appointments difficult. The mobile application enables photograph collection without the need for a biometrics appointment, enhancing processing efficiency for adjudicators and offering greater convenience for applicants. This will allow the user to complete the biometric verification requirement without having to attend an appointment at an Applicant Support Center. This reduces the burden on the beneficiary and decreases demands on USCIS Applicant Support Center resources.
