# Develop a Custom AI Model to Power Generative AI- Capabilities
## NARA-2024-0006
_National Archives and Records Administration_ (NARA) / 


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: NARA plans to build a custom AI model trained on its own data, which will improve the performance of its AI applications. This will lead to more accurate and relevant results, a better user experience, and new possibilities for using AI in managing and accessing records.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: This AI use case will output an AI model that is specifically trained on NARA's data and designed to meet NARA's unique needs.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Planned
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: TBD
