+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Improving the quality of written communications using AI tools.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The overarching objective for this project is development of a strategic framework for integrating ERP science with traditional information technology related platforms. The proposed framework includes (1) adoption of ML pipelines/models in ERP project workflows, tailored to specific needs of ERP project scientists; (2) modernization of key ERP data assets through API extension to meet the needs for data accessibility in big data platforms, analytics libraries, and machine learning models; and (3) technology transfer, targeted training, and multi-disciplinary career development for existing geospatial ERP workforce. Adoption of the proposed strategic framework will help us achieve this 21st century science vision and position the ERP to more effectively deliver its unique data-driven information products.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: see description
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency requested an extension for this AI use case, in response to the CAIO’s request, of up to one year for the minimum requirements outlined in Section 5 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: No – Agency did not request an extension for this use case.
