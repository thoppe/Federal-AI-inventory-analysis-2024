+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Digitizing text from scanned documents or smart forms for archival purposes using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: We use Microsoft Power Automate's AI builder to file our purchase orders on Sharepoint, as well as documents connected with them (invoices, returns, amendments, packing slips, etc). This saves staff time and makes it easy to respond to audits because all of the required documents are in 1 place with a consistent naming convention.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The AI puts the document into a PDF on Sharepoint and names it according to the Purchase Order Number and document type (538Q407568Amendment1, for example). The AI makes a folder for each PO number and all documents connected to that PO number go in the same folder.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Operation and Maintenance
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 5/1/2023

+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 7/28/2023
