# MedCoder - Coding literal text cause of death information reported on death certificates to ICD-10
## HHS-2024-0074
_Department of Health and Human Services_ (HHS) / CDC


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Health & Medical
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: MedCoder is a subsystem of CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System for coding causes of death indicated on the death certificates to the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes.

With the implementation of MedCoder, the percentage of deaths that can be automatically and accurately coded has risen from 70-75% using the previous coding system to over 85%. This improvement translates into substantial cost savings, amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars that would have been spent on manual coding. Additionally, it significantly enhances the timeliness of data related to urgent public health concerns such as COVID and drug overdose deaths, enabling near real-time surveillance.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: MedCoder assists with the identifying cause of death codes from death certificates using ICD-10 Underlying cause codes and automatically identifies and rejects complex causes of death as well as frequently miscoded ones, requiring manual coding or review. Additionally, in production, MedCoder utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to cleanse and standardize literal text cause of death statements before performing coding.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Operation and Maintenance
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 10/1/2017
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 2/1/2018
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 6/1/2022
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed in-house.
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: No
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Yes
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is widely available
+ **Identification of the demographic features explicitly utilized in the AI use case’s data/model(s), if any**: Sex/Gender
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: Yes – agency has access to source code, but it is not public.
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: National Vital Statistics System (NVSS)
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: More than 12 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: No
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: None: This use case does not re-use any internally developed tooling or managed infrastructure from any other AI development efforts within the agency.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Limited documentation for review: Some information regarding the model’s performance on specific benchmarks are available or have been shared with specific stakeholders within the agency.
