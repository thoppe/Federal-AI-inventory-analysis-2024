+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Health & Medical
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: This AI Use Case is Retired, No Longer in Use. This study investigated whether incorporating health-related risk factors can improve the predictive power of plasma biomarkers (related to neurodegeneration and inflammation) for incident dementia. 

Improve incident dementia prediction using plasma neurodegeneration biomarkers in a diverse population.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Using ~450 common health-related risk factors and plasma neurodegeneration and inflammation biomarkers from the population-based cohort with the follow-up period over 20 years - the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility – Reykjavik Study.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Retired
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case was retired or began the process of retirement**: 9/1/2024
