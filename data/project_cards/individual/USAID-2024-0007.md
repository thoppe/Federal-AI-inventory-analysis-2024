+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Health & Medical
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: AI technology was used to predict bed occupancy at hospitals with MoH data from 2019, with an overall median error by department around 20%. This was a proof-of-concept model developed at the request of the Institute of Public Health (IPH) Batut to understand how AI can work and the value add. CHISU was asked to subsequently focus on a different use case (waiting list optimization for scheduled imaging diagnostics services, specifically CT and MRI), which is considered higher priority to demonstrate the implementation of the national AI strategy and the effect of AI in data use for decision making by the government, and will be addressed in the 2023-4.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Time series
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Retired
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 7/14/1905
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 7/14/1905
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 7/14/1905
+ **Date when the AI use case was retired or began the process of retirement**: 7/15/1905
