# Identify infrastructure supports for physical activity (e.g. sidewalks) in satellite and roadway images
## HHS-2024-0041
_[Department of Health and Human Services](../3_agency/Department of Health and Human Services.md)_ (HHS) / CDC


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Health & Medical
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The physical environment, such as sidewalk availability, in areas may be correlated to levels of physical activity. The Physical Activity (PA) and Health Branch is responsible for monitoring and gathering data on physical activity behaviors, as well as assessing the environments that promote physical activity.

The implementation of this technology has the potential to streamline the surveillance of sidewalks, which play a crucial role in supporting physical activity (PA). The existing methods for cataloging sidewalks, such as manual inspection, are labor-intensive and costly. However, this technology has the capability to significantly minimize the effort required for such tasks.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity within CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion aims to explore and advance the use of machine learning methods for identifying sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and other relevant infrastructure in various types of images, including satellite and roadway images. The input data would consist of image-based data, while the outputs could take the form of geocoded data tables, maps, GIS layers, or summary reports. The goal is to develop and promote these techniques to enhance understanding and analysis of built environments related to physical activity.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 9/1/2022
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 9/1/2023
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with both contracting and in-house resources.
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: No
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: none - we used publicly-available images
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is complete
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: No
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: Less than 6 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: Re-use production level code from a different use-case: This use case re-uses production level code and/or internally developed code libraries for model development from existing AI systems or repositories inside the agency.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: No documentation is available: No documentation detailing model performance metrics, model architecture, features and intended use of the models have been created or are currently accessible to other data science teams within the agency.
