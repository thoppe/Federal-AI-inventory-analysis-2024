+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Evaluating AI Models for UAS Post-Fire Mapping Analysis Focusing on the Following Issues...
Post-Fire Damage Assessment:  Efficiently allocate resources for future rehabilitation efforts.
Vegetation Recovery Prediction:  Assess burn severity to estimate ecosystem regeneration speed.
Soil Erosion Risk Mapping:  Identify vulnerable areas and guide erosion control measures.
Habitat Restoration Planning:  Prioritize areas for reforestation, invasive species removal, and soil stabilization.
Water Quality Monitoring:  Predict sediment runoff, nutrient levels, and contaminants for future water management.
Structural Evolution Analysis and Prediction:  Analyze fire spread and growth to aid risk assessment and response planning.
Environmental Impact Assessment: Aid in planning rehabilitation efforts and assessing ecosystem resilience.
Risk Communication and Public Awareness: Inform communities about rehabilitation efforts and safety precautions.
Ongoing Post-Fire Rehabilitation Treatment Effects:  Assist BAER teams in assessing burned landscapes and monitoring ecological effects.
Cross-Disciplinary Integration:  Bridge communication gaps between experts in various fields for wildfire risk assessment.
Literature Reanalysis:  Assist researchers in developing insights, identifying gaps, and informing future research.
Assessing Damage and Recovery:  Identify fire-damaged objects (e.g., infrastructure, trees) to prioritize rehabilitation.
Monitoring Ecosystem Recovery:  Identify plant species, soil erosion patterns, and ecological indicators for restoration planning.
Identifying Hazards and Safety Risks:  Identify post-fire hazards (e.g., unstable terrain, debris) to ensure safety during rehabilitation.
Identifying Cultural and Archeological Objects: Identify relevant objects (e.g., artifacts, disturbances) for avoidance during rehabilitation.
Customized Rehabilitation Plans:  Detect specific objects (e.g., utility poles, contaminated soil) for tailored rehabilitation plans.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: see description
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: No
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Yes
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: UAS-derived
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: Yes – agency has access to source code, but it is not public.
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: No
+ **Whether the agency requested an extension for this AI use case, in response to the CAIO’s request, of up to one year for the minimum requirements outlined in Section 5 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: No – Agency did not request an extension for this use case.
