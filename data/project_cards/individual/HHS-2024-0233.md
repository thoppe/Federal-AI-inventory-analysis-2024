# NCI-DOE Collaboration, MOSSAIC project (Modeling Outcomes using Surveillance Data and Scalable AI for Cancer)
## HHS-2024-0233
_[Department of Health and Human Services](<../3_agency/Department of Health and Human Services.md>)_ (HHS) / NIH


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Health & Medical
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: MOSSAIC applies deep learning natural language processing (NLP) and foundation models to population-based cancer data collected by NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. DOE's Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL) has data use agreements (DUAs) with multiple SEER registries to access and train models using SEER data. To date, the MOSSAIC pathology-coding API is deployed in 22 SEER registries, moving the US towards near real-time cancer incidence reporting. Other APIs are still in the validation phase or research and development phase.

MOSSAIC enhances the infrastructure of the SEER cancer registries by providing tools that can increase the efficiency and accuracy of manual data abstraction by automatically extracting cancer surveillance data elements.  SEER registries receive millions of unstructured clinical text documents that must be manually reviewed, leading to a lag in reporting of US cancer incidence trends.  Automated tools such as those developed by MOSSAIC will help us achieve near real-time incidence trends and ultimately a more meaningful report card on the status of cancer in the US.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Input: unstructured (free text) cancer pathology reports.

Output: varies depending on the algorithm but generally a predicted class (eg, tumor site) and associated relative confidence score that can be used to tune accuracy.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Implementation and Assessment
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 1/1/2017
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 10/1/2017
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with contracting resources.
+ **Identification of the Procurement Instrument Identifier(s) (PIID) of the contract(s) used for the AI use case**: Developed under an Interagency Agreement with the US Department of Energy
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: No
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: Data is owned by the NCI SEER registries, which are funded by the NCI
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is complete
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: No
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: Yes – source code is publicly available.
+ **Link to publicly available source code for the AI use case, if available, in alignment with OMB Memorandum M-24-10’s section on sharing**: https://computational.cancer.gov/view-model-new?f%5B0%5D=project%3Amossaic&search_api_fulltext=&sort_by=title_1&sort_order=ASC&items_per_page=10
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: No
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: Less than 6 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: No
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: No
+ **Has the communication been timely**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: Re-use production level code from a different use-case: This use case re-uses production level code and/or internally developed code libraries for model development from existing AI systems or repositories inside the agency.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Limited documentation for review: Some information regarding the model’s performance on specific benchmarks are available or have been shared with specific stakeholders within the agency.
