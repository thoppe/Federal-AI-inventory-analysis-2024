+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Purpose/Objective of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Project: The primary objective of this AI project is to create rich and voluminous synthetic data for testing purposes. This synthetic data will be instrumental in enhancing the quality and comprehensiveness of various testing processes.
How It Accomplishes Its Purpose: At a high level, the project achieves its goal by ingesting data model schemas and generating scripts. These scripts are then used to create synthetic test data, ensuring that the generated data closely mimics real-world scenarios and datasets.
Decision or Judgment Automated by the Model: This AI tool automates the creation of synthetic data for testing purposes. It systematically generates data that can be used in various testing scenarios without the need for manual data creation.
Human Review of AI Output: Yes, humans are involved in reviewing the AI-generated synthetic data prior to taking action on the results. This step ensures that the data meets the required standards and is suitable for the intended testing purposes.
Anticipated Benefits: The project is expected to provide a robust framework for generating synthetic test data. This framework will facilitate the creation of comprehensive and high-volume test data, which is essential for conducting thorough performance, regression, and other types of tests.
Direct or Ultimate Impact: The ultimate impact of this decision is the availability of more comprehensive and increased volumes of test data. This enhanced data will support various testing activities, leading to more reliable and effective testing outcomes.
Population Impacted by This Decision: The primary population impacted by this decision includes testers and end users across ITPE and Individual Master File (IMF). These stakeholders will benefit from improved testing processes and outcomes.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Synthetic Test Data customized to user specification / requirements.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 10/21/2024
