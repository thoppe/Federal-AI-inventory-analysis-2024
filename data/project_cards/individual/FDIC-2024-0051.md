+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Other
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Financial Regulation
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Searching for information using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Algorithm, Language Processing Horizontal Analysis - Risk Examination (AlphaREx) analyzes unstructured narrative content in Information Technology (IT) examination workpapers and Reports of Examination (ROE) to provide meaningful, actionable insights into information. AlphaREx capabilities contribute to the FDIC’s Modernization initiative for the Supervision Modernization Business Drivers and supports the mission of the RMS Information Technology Section. 
Additionally, AlphaREx was developed to enable the automation, ingestion, analysis, and visualization of the information technology and operational unstructured and structured data gathered per the supervised financial institution.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Information collected across the IT Profile, FDIC Review of Examinations (ROEs), and multiple other sources (both unstructured/structured data) is a critical business need and is used by FDIC to promptly identify and address IT risks and Cyber risks for the FDIC Insured Deposit Institutions (IDIs).  In addition, this information is used to effectively identify trends, patterns and areas of improvement for the InTREx program; including training and changes to the FDIC IT Examination processes.

If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
