# DCIPHER (SEDRIC) AIP for Advanced Foodborne Outbreak Investigation (Receipt Reading)
## HHS-2024-0071
_Department of Health and Human Services_ (HHS) / CDC


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: This AI solution impacts the process of investigating foodborne disease outbreaks. These foodborne outbreaks require cooperative efforts from CDC staff, FDA, USDA, and local agencies and the AI system is used through a centralized data platform System for Enteric Disease Response, Investigation, and Coordination (also known as SEDRIC). For more information on SEDRIC, please go to our website: https://www.cdc.gov/foodborne-outbreaks/php/foodsafety/tools/index.html

SEDRIC's AIP use case provides CDC epidemiologists the ability to accelerate their investigations of multi-state foodborne disease outbreaks by more effectively leveraging data available in a rich data source, such as receipts from grocery stores, that otherwise requires extensive time and human effort to parse through. In addition, this workflow would free up epidemiologists' time and, potentially, increase the frequency with which both CDC and STLT partners could utilize shopper card, receipts, and free text responses to support investigations. Manually entering receipt information, shopper card information, or other such free text field is traditionally error prone and time intensive for a variety of information. This AI system provides a human-in-the-loop opportunity to review and update data entry points while reducing time spent by staff to gain these insights. Having a set structured output as well increased standardization of this information and eases reporting in situations requiring cooperation from multiple organizations.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) available within SEDRIC provides CDC epidemiologists the power to accelerate their investigations of multi-state foodborne disease outbreaks. It can extract structured data from grocery receipts, shopper card records, and free-text responses in order to catalog the food items purchased by affected patients. It can also map those items to SEDRIC-defined vehicles which categorize the items and highlight commonalities across patients, helping to pinpoint potential outbreak vehicles.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Operation and Maintenance
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 10/1/2023
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 10/1/2023
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 2/1/2024
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with contracting resources.
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: No
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: No
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: Data are used in outbreak/response scenarios, such as foodborne illness outbreak response. Data used is dependent on the situation and outbreak, and may be owned by CDC, FDA, USDA, State Health Departments, Tribal Health Departments, Local Health Departments, Territorial Health Departments, or other entities.
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation has been partially completed
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: Yes – agency has access to source code, but it is not public.
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: 1 CDC Data Platform (1CDP)
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: Less than 6 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: Use of existing data platforms: This use case is being developed on existing enterprise data and analytics platforms within the agency rather than procuring additional platforms or SaaS to operate.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Documentation has been published: Complete documentation has been published to a repository or data catalog within the agency and is made accessible to other data science teams for review and feedback.
