+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Summarizing the key points of a lengthy report using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: As part of a Chief Technology Officer (CTO) sponsored objective to enable and utilize Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) capabilities the User and Network Services Information Technology (IT) Service Desk in cooperation with Enterprise Operations will be implementing a limited production challenge to support AI generated Incident Summarization; providing agents with concise summary of case notes and history, Resolution Notes generation; generating accurate resolution notes based on actions taken and solution achieved, and Knowledge Article Generation; generating complete knowledgebase articles base on incident or case records. With the above we expect to see significant time savings when conducting warm handoffs between teams, while reducing the mean time to restore incidents. Additionally, the effort should ensure high-quality resolution notes are generated to assist in solving future incidents, while feeding existing knowledge review and publication processes potentially empowering self-service capabilities which will reduce time to closure activities.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Incident Summarization; providing agents with concise summary of case notes and history, Resolution Notes generation; generating accurate resolution notes based on actions taken and solution achieved, and Knowledge Article Generation; generating complete knowledgebase articles base on incident or case records
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
