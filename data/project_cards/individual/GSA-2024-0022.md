+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Other
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Facial matching for identity verification
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The purpose of Login.gov's identity verification service is to establish a link between the claimed identity and the subject creating a user account. The facial matching AI component of this service provides enhanced controls to protect users from identity fraud and the government from fraudulent access. 

The benefit to the user is to provide a fast, convenient way to prove their identity remotely and protect the public from identity theft.

The benefit to the government is to that government partners may use this tool to verify the identities of people accessing government websites in a remote, unattended session and protect Government systems from fraudulent access.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The system delivers a match/no-match output.

+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Rights-Impacting

GSA evaluated several facial-matching models in its Identity Proofing Performance Study using GSA data in a testing environment. More information about that study and the data it collected is available on this website and in GSA's Privacy Impact Assessment for the Study, which is located here under "GSA Identity Proofing Equity Study".

In addition to in-depth studies like above, GSA upholds best product monitoring practices, such as evaluating success rates at each identity verification step, including facial matching.
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is complete: Documentation exists regarding the maintenance, composition, quality, and intended use of the training and evaluation data, as well as any statistical bias across model features and protected groups.
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: No
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: No – agency does not have access to source code.
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: Login serves HISPs at VA, USDA, and SSA

This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: Less than 6 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Other
+ **Whether communication regarding the provisioning of requested resources for the AI use case has been timely**: Since this AI is a COTS SaaS solution, GSA does not currently have a process in place to train and develop the model. GSA will monitor its performance and include performance measures in contracts as needed.
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: Use of existing data platforms: This use case is being developed on existing enterprise data and analytics platforms within the agency rather than procuring additional platforms or SaaS to operate.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Documentation has been developed: Complete documentation detailing model performance across a range of benchmarks, architecture, relevant features and information regarding the appropriate use of the model for predictive tasks has been created.
+ **Whether the agency requested an extension for this AI use case, in response to the CAIO’s request, of up to one year for the minimum requirements outlined in Section 5 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Yes – Agency requested an extension for this use case.
+ **Whether an AI impact assessment for the AI use case has been completed, consistent with Section 5(c)(iv)(A) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10.

This can be informed by publicly known risks identified in similar use cases or contexts. Examples of such risks include at least physical injury, emotional/psychological injury, opportunity loss, economic loss, privacy loss, environmental impact, or civil rights and civil liberties impact**: AI outputs that are biased in certain ways, including by being discriminatory or have a discriminatory effect. This was identified by agency personnel through literature reviews and initial testing of facial matching algorithms.
+ **Whether an independent evaluation of the AI use case has been conducted through the CAIO, an agency AI oversight board, or other appropriate agency office with existing test and evaluation responsibilities, consistent with Section 5(c)(iv)(C) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10.

+ **Whether the agency has determined that the AI can carry out its individual core decisions or actions that could result in a significant impact on rights and safety without direct human involvement. The answer should not be “yes” if humans are not reviewing individual decisions and are only overseeing or reviewing the performance of the system in general**: No - Some individual decisions or actions require direct human oversight.

+ **How the agency has assessed whether there are significant disparities in the AI’s performance across demographic groups, including in the AI’s real-world deployment, consistent with Section 5(c)(v)(A) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: No
+ **How the agency has consulted affected groups, including underserved communities, in the design, development, and use of the AI, consistent with Section 5(c)(v)(B) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: To assess the potential risk of disparate outcomes, GSA is conducting the GSA Identity Proofing Performance Study (the “Study”) to understand how various vendors’ facial matching services perform across various demographics in uncontrolled environments similar to how this AI use case would operate.
- The preliminary results of the Study have already been helpful in acquisition and design decisions to mitigate the risk of biased outcomes. For example, Login.gov requested that BPA Call Order vendors provide both internal and independent research on their products, including requesting the NIST FRTE 1:1 Demographic Differentials Summary that examines the false negative rate of 1:1 facial matching algorithms for different demographics, which includes testing the algorithms with photographs of people who are African or African American.
- Over FY25, the Identity Proofing Performance Study team and academic partners will continue to evaluate the data and provide Login.gov with additional recommendations, which Login.gov will consider when maintaining and developing its service. For example, data from Login.gov’s operational identity-proofing process will be compared to similar datasets from the Study to develop and validate continuous performance indicators.
+ **How the agency has consulted affected groups, including underserved communities, in the design, development, and use of the AI, consistent with Section 5(c)(v)(B) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Post-transaction customer feedback collections
+ **Whether the agency has established a fallback and escalation process, which may include reverting to manual human processes, in the event that an impacted individual would like to appeal or contest an AI system’s outcome, consistent with Section 5(c)(v)(E) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has established an opt-out mechanism, consistent with Section 5(c)(v)(F) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Yes
