+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling

+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The resubmit checker takes a list of proposal IDs and returns a list of similar proposals submitted to NSF in the past, scored by their similarity.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: This is useful for identifying resubmitted proposals for several purposes: evaluating whether to return without review for lack of revision, ensuring continuity of merit review, and the analysis of broader resubmit trends.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Implementation and Assessment
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10.
