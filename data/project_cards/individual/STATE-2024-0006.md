## STATE-2024-0006
_Department of State_ (STATE) / BP/RPBI


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Inputting large amounts of data from paper forms into a digital system using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: BudgetChat (aka BudgetSearch) is expected to consolidate budget documents to make searching and summarizing them easier, thereby streamlining access and analysis of initiatives over multiple years and programs.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Summary of information that will be verified, reviewed, and edited by humans.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 7/26/2024
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 9/12/2024
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 12/1/2024
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with both contracting and in-house resources.
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: Budget documents that have been published from previous and current year.
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Yes
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
