# Data Management and Analytics Platform (DMAP) Operations and Governance AI Use Cases
## EPA-2024-0011
_Environmental Protection Agency_ (EPA) / Office of Mission Support


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Improve data quality, operational efficiency, and improved use of data to support mission outcomes
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Proposed use of AI and ML to enhance DMAP mission needs and operational excellence in the following areas:

Automated Data Quality Assessment
•	AI-augmented data profiling
•	Auto-detect data anomalies, missing values, outliers
•	Generate comprehensive data quality reports
•	Recommend data cleaning and transformation strategies
•	Provide statistical insights about dataset characteristics
AI-Augmented Data Documentation Generation
•	AI to aid in creating human-readable data dictionaries
•	Generate insights into semantic relationships between data elements
•	AI-augmented data lineage and provenance tracking documentation
AI-Driven Data Enrichment Recommendations
•	Suggest potential external data sources for enrichment
•	Recommend feature engineering techniques
•	Identify potential data joins and correlations
•	Flag opportunities for data augmentation
Workflow and Pipeline Automation
•	AI to aid in Extract Transform Load/Extract Load Transform (ETL/ELT) pipeline configurations
•	Create reproducible data transformation scripts
•	Develop dynamic data routing and processing workflows
•	Implement intelligent error handling and recovery mechanisms
Intelligent Onboarding Assistant
•	Guide users through data and project onboarding processes and workflows
•	Provide contextual recommendations during onboarding process
•	Validate/audit project requirements and compliance needs
•	Offer interactive tutorials and best practices
Predictive Data Governance
•	Recommend data access controls
•	Detect potential compliance risks
•	Augment analysis/validation/auditing and recommendations for data sensitivity levels
•	Suggest data anonymization and masking strategies
Feature Engineering for ML and Analysis
•	Auto-generate initial machine learning features
•	Identify potential model training datasets
•	Recommend preprocessing techniques
•	Highlight dataset suitability for specific ML tasks
Semantic Data Discovery
•	Create semantic knowledge graphs
•	Enable natural language querying of datasets
•	Aid in identifying and recommending data relationships across disparate sources
•	Support data catalogue generation
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 10/1/2024
