+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Government Services (includes Benefits and Service Delivery)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The artificial intelligence (AI) system for AccessGUDID will focus on enhancing data quality assurance by detecting anomalies in medical device metrics, such as inconsistent units of measurement or unusual device dimensions. It will analyze both structured data, like numerical measurements, and unstructured data, such as free text entries. The AI will not modify data directly but will flag potential issues for human review. Integrated into the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s processing workflow, it will leverage standard codes for precise grouping and employ advanced language models to process unstructured data. Deployed within the regulatory compliance and data management areas of NLM, this AI system aims to streamline data validation processes, reduce manual workload, and maintain the integrity of the AccessGUDID database, without overstepping into areas requiring human oversight.

The key problem the AI aims to address is the presence of inconsistent or incorrect data entries, such as mismatched units of measurement or outlier device dimensions, which can lead to regulatory compliance issues and potential risks in device usage. By automating the anomaly detection process, the AI will improve the efficiency of data validation, significantly reducing the manual effort required to identify and correct errors. This will not only enhance the accuracy of the data but also speed up the processing and integration of new submissions into the AccessGUDID database. Improved data integrity will lead to better decision-making for manufacturers, healthcare providers, and regulators, ensuring that medical devices on the market meet safety and performance standards. Ultimately, the positive outcomes of this AI application include increased trust in the medical device information provided to end users, which contributes to the broader goal of improving public health and ensuring patient safety across the nation.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: For inputs, it handles structured data, such as numerical metrics (e.g., device dimensions, units of measurement), and unstructured data, such as free-hand text entries describing medical devices. This data is sourced from the AccessGUDID database, which aggregates information submitted by manufacturers to the FDA. The frequency of data processing aligns with the batch submissions from the FDA, typically occurring daily or whenever new data is received. The system processes large volumes of data to detect anomalies, making it scalable to accommodate growing datasets. For outputs, the AI generates predictions and classifications, specifically identifying potential anomalies in the data, such as incorrect units of measurement or outlier device specifications. The results are presented as flags or labels indicating the presence of an anomaly, which are then reviewed by human analysts. The AI produces these results in real-time as part of the batch processing workflow, ensuring that each data submission is evaluated promptly before being fully integrated into the AccessGUDID database. The output helps in streamlining the data validation process and improving overall data quality.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 3/1/2024
