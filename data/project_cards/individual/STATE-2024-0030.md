# J Reports Data Collection & Management Tool (DCT)
## STATE-2024-0030
_[Department of State](../3_agency/Department of State.md)_ (STATE) / J


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Diplomacy & Trade; Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The DCT is an AI-driven research assistant designed to increase the quality and maintain the integrity of select Congressional reports while reducing the labor hours it takes to generate them. The tool automates the summarization, translation, and categorization of user-submitted content into a searchable database, replacing the manual tracking and organizing of research.  Users can upload materials throughout the year and easily retrieve content during drafting season.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The DCT provides AI-generated summaries and translations of user-submitted research.  It also suggests categories to organize the research according to instructions. The DCT uses optical character recognition (OCR) to digitize images and documents (e.g., PDFs).
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Implementation and Assessment
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 4/1/2023
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 6/20/2023
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 11/29/2023
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with both contracting and in-house resources.
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: No
+ **Identification of the High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) that the AI use case supports**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: No
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: No
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: DCT Evaluation Data: An internal research dataset of user-submitted articles, reviewed and labeled by subject matter experts to facilitate model evaluation.
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is widely available
+ **Identification of the demographic features explicitly utilized in the AI use case’s data/model(s), if any**: None
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Data.State-SBU
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: Data.State-SBU
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Documentation has been developed: Complete documentation detailing model performance across a range of benchmarks, architecture, relevant features and information regarding the appropriate use of the model for predictive tasks has been created.
