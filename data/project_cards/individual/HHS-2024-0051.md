# ChatCDC- CDC Enterprise GenAI Chatbot: Bring your own Enterprise Data (Data Analysis)
## HHS-2024-0051
_Department of Health and Human Services_ (HHS) / CDC


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: This AI system is an extension of the GenAI chatbot but is only available to a small group of pilot testers as of November 5, 2024. It operates through an ATO'ed instance of Microsoft Azure OpenAI through CDC's Enterprise Data Analytics and Visualization Platform. Using a method called retrieval augmented generation (RAG), this enhancement enables staff to augment the existing GenAI chatbot with access and “knowledge” of internal or enterprise data such as documents, spreadsheets, and PDFs. Additionally, each chatbot response has citations referencing to the sections of source text that informed the response, which facilitates human-in-the-loop validation for accuracy and relevancy of AI-generated content.

One way users are using this tool is for data extraction, which accelerates analysis of large document sets. By extracting key points from large volumes of text in various file formats, the enterprise-data-enhanced chatbot streamlines access to critical insights from reports, internal documentation, publications, and other documents. For example, one team is using the chatbot to support literature review by extracting information related to housing status and HIV in the US from a set of pre-screened publications. Examples of this information include a binary yes/no on whether the research paper focuses on the topic of interest, the paper’s population of focus, and the type of paper.

The enterprise data chatbot’s ability to quickly and accurately extract relevant information reduces manual search time and errors associated with human data retrieval. The output will be leveraged for more accurate data analysis, timely insights, and better-informed decision-making processes.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: When the user enters a prompt or query related to data extraction into the chatbot, the tool uses a GPT-4 model and Azure AI Search within a RAG architecture to retrieve relevant sections of text from the provided enterprise data sources and extract key information as instructed by the user’s prompt.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Implementation and Assessment
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 6/1/2024
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 6/1/2024
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with both contracting and in-house resources.
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: No
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: No
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: None
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is missing or not available
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: Yes – agency has access to source code, but it is not public.
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: Enterprise Data Analytics and Visualization (EDAV) Platform
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: Less than 6 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: Use of existing data platforms: This use case is being developed on existing enterprise data and analytics platforms within the agency rather than procuring additional platforms or SaaS to operate.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Documentation has been developed: Complete documentation detailing model performance across a range of benchmarks, architecture, relevant features and information regarding the appropriate use of the model for predictive tasks has been created.
