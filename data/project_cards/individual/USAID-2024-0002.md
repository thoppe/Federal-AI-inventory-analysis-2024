+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Health & Medical
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Using data from USAID funded Strengthening Integrated Delivery of HIV/AIDS Services (SIDHAS) project in Nigeria we trained and tested an algorithm that can be used for predicting the probability that someone newly initiated on ART will interrupt treatment. The algorithm has been successfully integrated into the Lafiya Management Information System (LAMIS), the individual-level client level electronic medical record system. Each week the outputs, for each new patient is shared with staff at the health facilities and those at high risk are provided with more intensive follow up support to reduce the risk of treatment interruption. We also conducted a qualitative assessment among to health care workers at the facilities to determine their perception of ML and determine what additional support are required for institutionalizing ML into their routine work.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Patient risk scores
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Retired
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Both
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 7/13/1905
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 7/13/1905
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 7/13/1905
+ **Date when the AI use case was retired or began the process of retirement**: 7/15/1905
