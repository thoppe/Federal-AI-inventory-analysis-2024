+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B:**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public:**: Using Machine Learning allows us to improve entity resolution as compared to rule based system.

PCIS offers the ability to see a person's immigration history organized in one place. Specific benefits do or will include: an organized summary view of the identity with the individual's latest photo from PCIS; full immigration history including receipts associated with the applicant, regardless of case management system; mailing, physical, and safe history of the individual organized in reverse chronological order, allowing users to easily find the most recent address; and all identifiers associated with the applicant, including A-Numbers, FINs, SSNs, SSNs, ELIS account numbers, passport numbers, etc.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc:**: Numerical likelihood score which is used to determine if the record belongs to the individual. Likelihood scores are subjected to a high threshold (.98, maximum 1) to assess whether the record belongs to the individual.
The vision of Person-Centric Identity Services (PCIS) is to be the authoritative source of trusted biographical and biometric information that provides real-time, two-way visibility between services into an individual's comprehensive immigration history and status. The de-duplication model ingests person-centric datasets from various source systems for model training and evaluation purposes. Our dataset includes biographic information (e.g., name, date of birth, alien number Social Security Number, passport number) as well as biographic information (e.g., fingerprint IDs, eye color, hair color, height, weight) for model training and matching purposes. Critical to the success of PCIS is the entity resolution and de-deduplication of individual records from various systems of records to create a complete picture of a person. Using machine learning (ML), the model can identify which case management records belong to the same unique individual with a high degree of confidence. This allows PCIS to compile a full immigration history for an individual without the need for time-consuming research across multiple disparate systems. The de-duplication model plays a critical role in the entity resolution and surfacing of a person and all their associated records. The ML models are more resilient to fuzzy matches and handle varying data fill rates more reliably.
