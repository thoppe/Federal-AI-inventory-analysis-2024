## VA-2024-0071
+ **Title of the AI use case:**: Privacy Act Automation Services - Disclosure.AI
+ **Agency responsible for the AI use case:**: Department of Veterans Affairs
+ **Agency abbreviation:**: VA
+ **Specific organization(s) within the agency responsible for the AI use case:**: VBA: Veterans Benefits Administration
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: Government Services (includes Benefits and Service Delivery)
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: 
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B:**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public:**: The PAA System will automate PA workflows that are currently highly manual. Automating PA processing will benefit Veterans by decreasing the time they have to wait to receive requested records, and it will benefit the VA by reducing the time that staff need to support PA request processing. Tools/techniques that may be categorized as AI improve the automated processing that provide these benefits, but AI technology is ancillary to other technology utilized in the PAA system. Machine learning is used to identify specific documents (DD-214, Decision Letters, Service Records, etc.) and AI is used to improve and expedite data extraction as well as identify and apply automated redactions. The process is designed with Human in the Loop (HITL) and Government in the Loop (GITL) roles.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc:**: The PAA System automates the process of ingesting PA requests, retrieving requested records, and redacting requested records when necessary. The outputs of the PAA System are reviewed by Deloitte’s managed service team and by the VA for accuracy and completeness before the requested records are sent to the requester. The outputs consist of records held by VBA within Claim Evidence (VBMS) that have appropriate redactions applied for 3rd party information before release to the 1st party requestor or their designee.
