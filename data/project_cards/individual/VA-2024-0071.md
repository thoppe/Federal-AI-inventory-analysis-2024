# Privacy Act Automation Services - Disclosure.AI
## VA-2024-0071
_[Department of Veterans Affairs](../3_agency/Department of Veterans Affairs.md)_ (VA) / VBA: Veterans Benefits Administration


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Government Services (includes Benefits and Service Delivery)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The PAA System will automate PA workflows that are currently highly manual. Automating PA processing will benefit Veterans by decreasing the time they have to wait to receive requested records, and it will benefit the VA by reducing the time that staff need to support PA request processing. Tools/techniques that may be categorized as AI improve the automated processing that provide these benefits, but AI technology is ancillary to other technology utilized in the PAA system. Machine learning is used to identify specific documents (DD-214, Decision Letters, Service Records, etc.) and AI is used to improve and expedite data extraction as well as identify and apply automated redactions. The process is designed with Human in the Loop (HITL) and Government in the Loop (GITL) roles.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The PAA System automates the process of ingesting PA requests, retrieving requested records, and redacting requested records when necessary. The outputs of the PAA System are reviewed by Deloitte’s managed service team and by the VA for accuracy and completeness before the requested records are sent to the requester. The outputs consist of records held by VBA within Claim Evidence (VBMS) that have appropriate redactions applied for 3rd party information before release to the 1st party requestor or their designee.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Implementation and Assessment
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 1/10/2023
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 9/27/2023
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 11/18/2024
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed in-house.
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: Yes
+ **Identification of the High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) that the AI use case supports**: Veterans Benefits Administration
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Description of how the agency is ensuring that this AI use case is compliant with Information Quality Act guidelines and OMB Memorandum M-19-15, if applicable**: N/A. D.AI does not involve scientific, financial, or statistical information.
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Yes
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: Agency Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) data is used to track pending and completed Privacy Act requests for information and their respective performance metrics, to include average days pending and average days to complete to ensure the D.AI solution exceeds the metrics for the existing manual process and meets the contractually obligated service levels for accuracy and turn around (completion) times.
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation has been partially completed: Some documentation exists (detailing the composition and any statistical bias or measurement skew for training and evaluation purposes), but documentation took place within this use case’s development.
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: No – agency does not have access to source code.
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: Privacy Act Automation/Disclosure.AI
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: More than 12 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: No
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: None: This use case does not re-use any internally developed tooling or managed infrastructure from any other AI development efforts within the agency.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Limited documentation for review: Some information regarding the model’s performance on specific benchmarks are available or have been shared with specific stakeholders within the agency.
