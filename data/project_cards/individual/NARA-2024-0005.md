## NARA-2024-0005
_[National Archives and Records Administration](<../3_agency/National Archives and Records Administration.md>)_ (NARA) / 


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: NARA plans to use AI to automate the declassification of documents, making the process faster, more accurate, and transparent. This will improve efficiency, ensure consistency in applying declassification rules, and ultimately make more information available to the public.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: This AI use case will output declassified documents with sensitive information redacted, ready for public release.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Planned
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: TBD
