_[Department of Housing and Urban Development](<../3_agency/Department of Housing and Urban Development.md>)_ (HUD) / Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO)


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Customer Experience Team works across the department to develop a deep understanding of who our customers are and how we can best serve their needs. The Voice of the Customer application brings the best-in-class voice transcription, speech, and text analytics to customer feedback surveys,  contact center calls and chats. It allows HUD to unlock critical insights that provide deeper understanding of how to support and manage our program/service delivery and contact center providers, and ultimately to improve customers’ experiences.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: A data analytics dashboard that transforms customer feedback into succinct, easy-to-understand metrics, such as customer satisfaction rates across different customer interaction and call center topics.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Operation and Maintenance
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 1/15/2024
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 9/30/2022
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 8/30/2024
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with contracting resources.
+ **Identification of the Procurement Instrument Identifier(s) (PIID) of the contract(s) used for the AI use case**: 86614922C00009
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Other
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the rights datasets to begin model development**: This AI use case is part of a larger system that collects data directly from HUD customers
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: This system allows HUD to build surveys of varying complexity, distribute surveys via different delivery methods, centrally manage customer feedback data, and enable enterprise-wide qualitative and quantitative data analysis on both data collected through the system and data imported into the system.  The Voice of the Customer data can come in through a variety of ways. It can be a web/paper survey, a phone call, an email, or anything having all that separate data on one platform will help OCFO’s Customer Experience team hear what customers have to say holistically. The gathered feedback is both customer and employee experience data as it pertains to their interactions with HUD. Contact information will be requested, but is voluntary/optional, and is only collected/used for future research. This would include gathering a person’s name and contact information they are willing to provide (email or phone number). This data would be used for research purposes only to further investigate how to improve customers’ experiences with HUD.  These interactions would include moments when the customer/employee interacts with HUD (For example, a customer visits the HUD website for information, or an employee visits the intranet for information). The data would be collected via surveys or conversations regarding their experience within that specific moment and/or overall experience.
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is complete: Documentation exists regarding the maintenance, composition, quality, and intended use of the training and evaluation data, as well as any statistical bias across model features and protected groups.
+ **Identification of the demographic features explicitly utilized in the AI use case’s data/model(s), if any**: None
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: No
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: No – agency does not have access to source code.
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: P351 Voice of the Customer (VoC)
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: Less than 6 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: None: This use case does not re-use any internally developed tooling or managed infrastructure from any other AI development efforts within the agency.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Documentation has been developed: Complete documentation detailing model performance across a range of benchmarks, architecture, relevant features and information regarding the appropriate use of the model for predictive tasks has been created.
+ **Whether the agency requested an extension for this AI use case, in response to the CAIO’s request, of up to one year for the minimum requirements outlined in Section 5 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: No - Use Case is not Rights or Safety impacting, section 5 does not apply
