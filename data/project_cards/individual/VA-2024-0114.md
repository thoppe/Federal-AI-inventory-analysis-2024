+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Creating visual representations of data sets for reports and presentations using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: We do a lot of coding in various languages java, SQL, Mquery, DAX, Fx, python and R.  While being able to use this product and other products like ASkSage and ChatGPT.  It has had a lot of use in identifying code errors, improving performance of code to better load data in other systems in VA and providing insights on new ways to code in many programs.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The AI system's outputs can be categorized into several types, depending on the task or question being addressed. Here are some examples:  Math and Logic Problems  Step-by-step solutions to math problems, including algebra, geometry, calculus, and other branches of mathematics Logical explanations and derivations for logic problems, including propositional and predicate logic Coding and Programming  Code snippets in various programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript, with clear explanations and comments Detailed code reviews and suggestions for improvement Algorithmic solutions to programming challenges and problems Creative Writing and Role-Play  Original creative writing pieces, such as short stories, poems, or dialogues, in response to prompts or requests Engaging role-play scenarios, including character development and interactive storytelling Analysis and Discussion  In-depth analysis of topics, including scientific concepts, historical events, and cultural phenomena Well-structured and coherent arguments, with evidence and supporting examples Engaging discussions and debates on various topics, with respectful and open-minded dialogue Teaching and Explanation  Clear and concise explanations of complex concepts, broken down into manageable parts Step-by-step tutorials and guides for learning new skills or subjects Patient and supportive feedback, with suggestions for improvement and further learning General Discussion and Q&A  Concise and accurate answers to factual questions, with sources and references when available Engaging and respectful conversations on various topics, with active listening and thoughtful responses Overall, the AI system's outputs are designed to be informative, engaging, and helpful, with a focus on clarity, accuracy, and respect for the user's time and interests
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 8/1/2024
