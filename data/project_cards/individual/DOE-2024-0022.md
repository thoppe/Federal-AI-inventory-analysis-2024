+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Identifying unusual patterns in system logs from a single incident report using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Proactively identify, mitigate, and respond to threats. Copilot assists in real-time monitoring, threat detection, incident response automation, and vulnerability management.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The intended outputs of using Microsoft Copilot for Security at PNNL include real-time threat detection, automated incident response, enhanced data protection, compliance reports, security insights, reduced cyber risk, and sustained operational continuity
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
