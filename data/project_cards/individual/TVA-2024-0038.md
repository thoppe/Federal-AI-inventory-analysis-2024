+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Searching for information using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Portal users can find answers more quickly and easily with features like auto-complete search queries, natural language support, and typo handling.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Knowledge Base Catalog Data
