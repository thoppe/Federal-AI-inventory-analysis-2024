+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Energy & the Environment
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI‚Äôs intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency‚Äôs mission and/or the general public**: Project aimed at the development of the Illegal Logging and Deforestation Alert System in Ukraine (ùõÉ-version) based on the results of  the DeepForest Project (created ùõÇ-version of the system). It is an IT-based service that will allow its users to detect potential illegal and monitor planned forest logging. The system intends to analyze satellite data on forest cover changes and compare it with open source data published by public institutions (e.g. state land use and ownership maps, forest maps, logging tickets, etc.). The service will reflect near real-time deforestation changes indicating how many forests disappeared from the forest map of Ukraine, when and where it happened, and whether there are appropriate government permits (logging tickets) for felling.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it‚Äôs a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Annotated maps
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Retired
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer ‚Äúneither‚Äù to this question without a formal determination made by your agency‚Äôs Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case was retired or began the process of retirement**: 3/1/2022
