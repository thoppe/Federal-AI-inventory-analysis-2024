+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Energy & the Environment
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Searching for information using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: In response to OMB interest—which we agree with—in giving researchers more visibility when we cite their work, National Center for Environmental Economics (NCEE) is investigating various methods to document citations in economic analysis and other regulatory documents. We have explored using GovChat to extract references from regulatory documents.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Output would be lists of unique references by document, which can then be combined into a list with counts. The list could then be used to acknowledge researchers whose work is used by EPA.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
