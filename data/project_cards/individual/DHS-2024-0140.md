# Plan of Day Staff Optimization
## DHS-2024-0140
_[Department of Homeland Security](<../3_agency/Department of Homeland Security.md>)_ (DHS) / TSA


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Transportation
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Plan of Day will automate TSA screening staff optimization.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Staffing operations models prescribing when screening lanes should be opened/closed, when/where screening staff is required to absorb operational peaks, determining optimal gender and certification ratios, recommending when to schedule overtime/shift adjustments, drafting lane rotation plans, and informing national TSA staffing requirements as prescribed optimization plans deviate as airline schedules shift.
Plan of Day is the Transportation Security Administration’s (TSA’s) approach to modernize screening resource allocations, leverage data to inform decisions, and realize efficiencies. Plan of Day leverages AI to assist in checkpoint operational determinations and activities by conducting historical data analytics to help determine optimal screening lane hours and locations, predict necessary staffing requirements, and provide notifications to Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) when scheduling and leave requests are approved. 

Plan of Day will automate TSA screening staff optimization though models capable of prescribing when screening lanes should be opened/closed, determining when/where screening staff is required to absorb operational peaks, determining optimal gender and certification ratios, recommending when to schedule overtime/shift adjustments, drafting lane rotation plans, and informing national TSA staffing requirements, factoring in changes to both optimization plans airline schedules. 
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 10/1/2017
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 10/1/2017
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with both contracting and in-house resources.
+ **Identification of the Procurement Instrument Identifier(s) (PIID) of the contract(s) used for the AI use case**: DHS, S&T Contract Number: 70RSAT21PI00001
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: Yes
+ **Identification of the High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) that the AI use case supports**: Transportation Security Administration – DHS
+ **Identification of the specific public-facing service that the AI use case supports**: Completing TSA passenger screening
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Yes
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: STIP CAT data and PMIS passenger throughput data; PIMS historic throughput of screening equipment; Master Checkpoint List/Location Codes; Salesforce Master Airport List; HR data via eTAS, NFC, and OLC; AIMs data for airport logistic information; OAG for flight information; Google weather and traffic
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is complete: Documentation exists regarding the maintenance, composition, quality, and intended use of the training and evaluation data, as well as any statistical bias across model features and protected groups.
+ **Identification of the demographic features explicitly utilized in the AI use case’s data/model(s), if any**: None
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: No
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: More than 12 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Other
+ **Explanation for whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: DHS Science and Technology accepted the project via a formal intake process.
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: None: This use case does not re-use any internally developed tooling or managed infrastructure from any other AI development efforts within the agency.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Documentation has been published: Complete documentation has been published to a repository or data catalog within the agency and is made accessible to other data science teams for review and feedback.
