+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Other
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: None
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The M2020 onboard scheduler incrementally constructs a feasible schedule by iterating through activities in priority-first order. When considering each activity it computes the valid time intervals for placement, taking into account preheating, maintenance heating, and wake/sleep of the rover as required. After an activity is placed (other than a preheat/maintenance or wake/sleep), the activity is never reconsidered by the scheduler for deletion or moving. Therefore the scheduler can be considered non backtracking, and only searches in the sense that it computes valid timeline intervals for legal activity placement.  Meta Search: Because the onboard scheduler will be invoked many times in a given sol (Martian Day) with a range of possible contexts (due to execution variations), its non backtracking nature leaves its vulnerable to brittleness. In order to mitigate this potential brittleness, the Copilot systems perform a monte carlo based stochastic analysis to set meta parameters of the scheduler - primarily activity priority but also potentially preferred time and temporal constraints.      Also: Research, experiments, and engineering to empower future rovers with onboard autonomy; planning, scheduling & execution; path planning; onboard science; image processing; terrain classification; fault diagnosis; and location estimation.  This is a multi-faceted effort and includes experimentation and demonstrations on-site at JPL's simulated mars navigation yard.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Planning and scheduling recommendations
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: In mission
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 1/1/2016
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 1/1/2018
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 7/1/2020
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with both contracting and in-house resources.
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: No
+ **Identification of the specific public-facing service that the AI use case supports**: None
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Description of how the agency is ensuring that this AI use case is compliant with Information Quality Act guidelines and OMB Memorandum M-19-15, if applicable**: NASA's data stewardship best practices are in effect under guidance from the Chief Data Officer.
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: No
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the rights datasets to begin model development**: Blank/Not Provided
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: As a Mission-embedded system on Mars Rover, ATO, public dissemination, SAOP, HISP, etc. do not apply
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Yes
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: No.  Engineering Review and Resease instead.
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: Multiple approved space-based systems
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: Less than 6 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: No
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: This work built-upon prior rovers
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Yes
