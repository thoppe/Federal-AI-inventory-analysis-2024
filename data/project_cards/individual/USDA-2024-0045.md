+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The purpose of the model is to improve the Economic Research Service (ERS) research approval process. The system reduces the time it takes to fill out information and seeking approval, improves information accuracy, and brings visibility to the approval status across various division functions.
