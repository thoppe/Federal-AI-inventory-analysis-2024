+ **Title of the AI use case:**: AI Assisted Compromise Email Detector (AACED)
+ **Agency responsible for the AI use case:**: Department of Homeland Security
+ **Agency abbreviation:**: DHS
+ **Specific organization(s) within the agency responsible for the AI use case:**: ICE
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: Mission-Enabling
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: 
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B:**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public:**: The use case was developed to assist ICE SOC in reviewing a collection of emails between ICE personnel and Microsoft that were part of ED 24-02.  The use case provides a faster mechanism to the SOC analysts to determine indicators of compromise, reducing the level of effort for these individuals’ analysis exponentially.  To assist the analysts, Named Entity Recognition (NER) was used to detect PII and other associated keywords to increase analyst productivity, and reduce time required to analyze emails.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc:**: Outputs are named entities and generated text for specific questions. Chat interface for analyst to conduct Q&A with email as context.
The AI Assisted Compromise Email Detector (AACED) helps prioritize which emails human security analysts should investigate first to identify cyber compromise ICE. This use case reports AI-enabled analysis on a one-time export of emails between ICE and Microsoft relevant to Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Emergency Directive 24-02. This use case does not perform live email analysis and only includes emails sent to/from ICE email accounts. 

The Information Assurance Division (IAD) within ICE is responsible for providing Cybersecurity Services to ICE, including operating the ICE Security Operations and Computer Security Incident Response Center through its Cyber Defense & Intelligence Branch. The Branch performs information assurance mitigation, responds to (and reports on) Information Technology (IT) security incidents, performs systems vulnerability testing, and monitors and evaluates the security performance on sensitive enterprise systems. CISA published Emergency Directive (ED) 24-02: Mitigating the Significant Risk from Nation-State Compromise of Microsoft Corporate Email System in which all Federal Government Agencies were required to review the stored email metadata from Microsoft to determine if they were affected from the breach. This requires the investigation of tens of thousands of emails to determine if there were any signs of compromise or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage. 

The use case was developed to assist ICE Security Operations Center (SOC) in reviewing a collection of emails between ICE personnel and Microsoft that were part of ED 24-02.  It provides a faster mechanism for SOC analysts to determine indicators of compromise, reducing the level of effort for these individuals’ analysis exponentially.  To assist the analysts, Named Entity Recognition (NER) was used to detect PII and other associated keywords while a locally running Large Language Model (LLM), with no external connections, answers questions about selected emails.  The LLM also answers preset questions formulated from Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). The analysts use the outputs to expedite the detection of PII and key language within emails, reducing the time needed to analyze the total collection of emails.  If the use case detects PII or key language, then those emails are ranked as higher risk and prioritized by the analyst. The analyst then inspects the email at that location for presence of the data and logs it manually allowing for specified actions based on the results of the analysts’ review.  Ultimately, all emails are manually inspected and depending on the circumstance of the investigation the ICE Privacy Office may be contacted notifying them of the PII that was exposed, or the analyst will provide the information to the SOC Leadership to initiate the incident response process to perform remediation actions needed.  The use case only provides ranking for prioritized processing to the SOC analysts.
