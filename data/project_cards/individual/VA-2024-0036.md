+ **Title of the AI use case:**: Potential Fraud or Waste
+ **Agency responsible for the AI use case:**: Department of Veterans Affairs
+ **Agency abbreviation:**: VA
+ **Specific organization(s) within the agency responsible for the AI use case:**: OM: Office of Management

+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: 
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B:**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public:**: The Purchase Card dashboards are a suite of dashboards that allow various purchase card managers to monitor purchase card spending of employees. The dashboards help monitor for fraud, waste, and abuse, and assist in providing oversight for compliance with purchase card laws and policies. We have now incorporated advanced data analytics within the dashboard. The Advanced data Analytics model generates an expected received date for items. It then flags items that have gone beyond the expected generated date by flagging items that were received late (possible waste) and/or items that have not been received yet (possible fraud). This has the potential to save the analyst time by investigating cases that have been flagged as opposed to investigating potentially an entire dataset, which is what they have been doing up until now. The model analyzes all purchase card transactions including ordered, delivery, and recieved dates as its inputs. It outputs expected recieved dates. The intended users of the product are purhase card managers.
