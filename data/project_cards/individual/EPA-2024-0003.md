+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Energy & the Environment
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Searching for information using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Provide a chatbot to respond to EPA monitoring system analyst questions about the emission monitoring programs, including historical regulatory changes and the reasons for those changes.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Using preambles and regulatory text, respond to questions such as:
- What is the grace period for performing a relative accuracy quality assurance test?
- In what year were the monitoring performance criteria last updated and what was the justification?
- What monitoring options are available for an oil-fired power plant?
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
