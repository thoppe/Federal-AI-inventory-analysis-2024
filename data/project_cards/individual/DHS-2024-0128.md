+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Enhanced Threat Detection: Identify patterns in user behaviors that deviate from normal baselines, signaling potential insider threats or security risks. Continuous Risk Assessment: Move from static vetting to a continuous vetting process by monitoring real-time activities and interactions with secure information.
Improved Incident Response: Enable rapid responses to high-risk behaviors, escalating alerts for timely intervention by security personnel."
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Behavioral Baseline Modeling: Develop a baseline for each individual based on regular access patterns, network usage, and interactions with classified data or secure areas.
Anomaly Detection: Employ machine learning models to detect deviations from established baselines, such as unusual access times, atypical access to high-sensitivity resources, or excessive data downloads.
Risk Scoring: Assign a risk score to each user based on observed anomalies, factoring in historical behavior, job role, and access level, allowing security teams to prioritize investigations.
Automated Alerts & Reporting: Generate automated alerts for high-risk behaviors or patterns of concern and deliver timely reports to personnel security teams for further investigation."
As part of the personnel security vetting process for continuous vetting-eligible employees, employees provide information and authorize access to information about themselves, including criminal history, credit reports, and other information. This information is collected and collated on an ongoing basis. UEAB presents aggregated information in a structured manner to help prioritize staffing.  Additionally, pursuant to and as authorized by Executive Order 13467, “Reforming Processes Related to Suitability for Government Employment, Fitness for Contractor Employees, and Eligibility for Access to Classified National Security Information,” employees must be enrolled in a continuous vetting program.   

UEBA enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and effectiveness of personnel security processes by aggregating information provided by or authorized to be collected by an employee about the employee.   

The AI output is the collated information is a risk matrix for human review. The AI output uses a hard coded scoring system to provide alerts for collated information that presents greater risk in the vetting process.  Staff reviews the risk matrix and uses the collated information in the matrix as background information for the personnel security vetting process. The collated information supports decisions about staffing priorities. 
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Operation and Maintenance
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 10/1/2020
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 4/3/2021
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 7/8/2023
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with both contracting and in-house resources.
+ **Identification of the Procurement Instrument Identifier(s) (PIID) of the contract(s) used for the AI use case**: PIID Pending, not yet issued.
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Yes
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: PII, SPII , Clearance and Background Investigation Data: Data from security clearances, background investigations, and adjudication records.
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is complete: Documentation exists regarding the maintenance, composition, quality, and intended use of the training and evaluation data, as well as any statistical bias across model features and protected groups.
+ **Identification of the demographic features explicitly utilized in the AI use case’s data/model(s), if any**: None
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: Yes – agency has access to source code, but it is not public.
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: Vetting Identities for an Enterprise Workforce
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: More than 12 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: Use of existing data platforms: This use case is being developed on existing enterprise data and analytics platforms within the agency rather than procuring additional platforms or SaaS to operate.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Limited documentation for review: Some information regarding the model’s performance on specific benchmarks are available or have been shared with specific stakeholders within the agency.
