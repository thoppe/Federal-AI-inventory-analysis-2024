# Immunization Information Systems Guidance Documentation Navigation and Management (IDAB EDAV Azure OpenAI Technology Use)
## HHS-2024-0042
_[Department of Health and Human Services](<../3_agency/Department of Health and Human Services.md>)_ (HHS) / CDC


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: This AI solution (chatbot) helps with retrieving information and updating guidance documentation by increasing interactivity and discoverability of information in the Immunization Information Systems (IIS) domains of HL7 electronic data exchange standards, CDSi (Clinical decision support for immunizations), and IIS operational best practices. It provides a modernized approach to knowledge retrieval and real-time guidance, as well as support the creation of new guidance by leveraging the AI capabilities in natural language processing and content generation to draft, refine, and validate new guidance documents efficiently and accurately.

This AI solution creates a better, faster, and more actionable method for IIS SMEs to obtain IIS guidance from previously published and publicly available IIS documentation. This solution will provide a more modernized approach to knowledge retrieval and real-time guidance, as well as support the creation of new guidance by leveraging the chatbots capabilities in natural language processing and content generation to draft, refine, and validate new guidance documents efficiently and accurately.
This AI solution (chatbot) provides an efficient and user-friendly way to search, interact, and update these IIS guidance documents. It can help experts answer questions faster, new employees find information more easily, and employees better understand best practices.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: This AI solution (chatbot) uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve and synthesize information from a limited set of publicly available IIS guidance documents related to the HL7 Electronic Exchange Standard specification, Clinical Decision Support for Immunization (CDSi) and IIS Operational Best Practices. It does this using a Question-and-Answer style interface, allowing team members to retrieve answers in an efficient and user-friendly way.
On 07/26/2024 the CDC Information Technology and Data Governance (ITDG) Executive Committee has approved this investment “to use AI to create a system that can conduct a dialogue with a user and answer questions about the contents of already approved public documents”.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 10/1/2022
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 8/1/2024
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with both contracting and in-house resources.
+ **Identification of the Procurement Instrument Identifier(s) (PIID) of the contract(s) used for the AI use case**: 75D301-22-C-13291, 75D30124C20195
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: No
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: We did not do any training or fine tuning, but we used the following materials to evaluate the chatbot: HL7 Documentation Data, CDSi Logic Specification 4.4 Data. This information is entirely publicly accessible.
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is widely available
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: Enterprise Data Analytics and Visualization (EDAV) Platform
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: Less than 6 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: Re-use production level code from a different use-case: This use case re-uses production level code and/or internally developed code libraries for model development from existing AI systems or repositories inside the agency.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Documentation has been developed: Complete documentation detailing model performance across a range of benchmarks, architecture, relevant features and information regarding the appropriate use of the model for predictive tasks has been created.
