+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: 
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B:**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public:**: This AI solution (chatbot) helps with retrieving information and updating guidance documentation by increasing interactivity and discoverability of information in the Immunization Information Systems (IIS) domains of HL7 electronic data exchange standards, CDSi (Clinical decision support for immunizations), and IIS operational best practices. It provides a modernized approach to knowledge retrieval and real-time guidance, as well as support the creation of new guidance by leveraging the AI capabilities in natural language processing and content generation to draft, refine, and validate new guidance documents efficiently and accurately.

This AI solution creates a better, faster, and more actionable method for IIS SMEs to obtain IIS guidance from previously published and publicly available IIS documentation. This solution will provide a more modernized approach to knowledge retrieval and real-time guidance, as well as support the creation of new guidance by leveraging the chatbots capabilities in natural language processing and content generation to draft, refine, and validate new guidance documents efficiently and accurately.
This AI solution (chatbot) provides an efficient and user-friendly way to search, interact, and update these IIS guidance documents. It can help experts answer questions faster, new employees find information more easily, and employees better understand best practices.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc:**: This AI solution (chatbot) uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve and synthesize information from a limited set of publicly available IIS guidance documents related to the HL7 Electronic Exchange Standard specification, Clinical Decision Support for Immunization (CDSi) and IIS Operational Best Practices. It does this using a Question-and-Answer style interface, allowing team members to retrieve answers in an efficient and user-friendly way.
