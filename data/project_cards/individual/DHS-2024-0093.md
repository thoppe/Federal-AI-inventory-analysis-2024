## DHS-2024-0093
+ **Title of the AI use case:**: Individual Assistance (IA) & Public Assistance (PA) Projections
+ **Agency responsible for the AI use case:**: Department of Homeland Security
+ **Agency abbreviation:**: DHS
+ **Specific organization(s) within the agency responsible for the AI use case:**: FEMA
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: Government Services (includes Benefits and Service Delivery)
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: 
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B:**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public:**: The purpose of these supervised learning models is two-fold:

1.	For informational purposes: the models will produce predictions for to-be-determined quantities of interest. These quantities are often of interest to Agency personnel in the field, region, and headquarters, as well as DHS, OMB, NSC, and the Whitehouse.
2.	For decisional purposes: in addition to being informative, the model’s predictions are likely to be used for decision making. This may include implicit use (e.g., seeing that there are a large number of households that require assistance may motivate FEMA CFO to consider requesting additional funding for the Disaster Relief Fund) or explicit use (e.g., the number of estimated housing units required may be used to determine the number of housing units to order just-in-time).

Anticipated benefits of using supervised learning models include:
1.	Increased predictive performance: supervised learning models offer means of quantifying and choosing models with the best possible predictive performance.
2.	Timely prediction: supervised learning models can produce reasonably high performance predictions based on limited data.
3.	Quantification of uncertainty: supervised learning models are able to provide prediction intervals and predictive distributions in addition to point predictions to give users a sense of how uncertainty is inherent in the prediction.
4.	Rigor: supervised learning models are well founded on statistical learning theory and provide a level of mathematical rigor that speaks to the reliability and limitations of methods.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc:**: These supervised learning models produce predictions, not recommendations and not decisions (though they can be used to inform human users in making recommendations and decisions).

At minimum, these supervised learning models will produce point predictions for the different quantities of interest for disaster declarations. Additionally supervised learning models may produce prediction intervals or predictive distributions as feasible and appropriate for the given prediction problem. Often these outputs will be shared via business intelligence tools (e.g., Tableau or PowerBI) for wide internal FEMA use. Some predictions may be shared to a more restricted audience through simpler means (e.g., an excel workbook) as appropriate.
Individual Assistance (IA) and Public Assistance (PA) Projections predicts recovery program quantities of interest using supervised learning models. These models include, but not limited to, predicting the number of households that will register for the Individuals and Households Program (IHP), the number of households that will require direct housing assistance, the number of temporary transitional housing units needed, the number of applicants for Public Assistance, the number of PA projects that applicants will submit, the number of sites that will need to be inspected per PA project, and the cost of delivering assistance.  Supervised learning models include sample statistics, generalized linear models, decision trees, and deep neural networks. 

The purpose of these supervised learning models is for informational purposes, to produce predictions for to-be-determined quantities of interest and for decisional purposes that may include implicit use (e.g., seeing a large number of households requiring assistance may motivate FEMA Chief Financial Officer (CFO) to consider requesting additional funding for the Disaster Relief Fund) or explicit use (e.g., the number of estimated housing units required may be used to determine the number of housing units to order just-in-time). Anticipated benefits of using supervised learning models include increased predictive performance, timely predictions, quantification of uncertainty, and rigor.
