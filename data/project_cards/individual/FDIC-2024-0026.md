+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Other
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Financial Regulation
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The monitoring of prohibited and restricted purchase card information is a manually intensive process, whereas a Machine Learning (M/L) algorithm would have a level of complexity to determine whether purchases fit within those distinct set of parameters.  This AI use cases would require the development of a training and test dataset based on actual activity  in order to determine a true level of accuracy for the Machine Learning (M/L) algorithm.  The data would then feed into a dashboard/report.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The Machine Learning (M/L) would provide a data extract on prohibited and restricted purchase card activity across the FDIC.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 2/1/2023
