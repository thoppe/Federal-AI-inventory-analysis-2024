+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: 
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B:**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public:**: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Enterprise Services (ES), Enterprise Systems Testing (EST) is the testing authority for Information Technology (IT) and provides enterprise-wide testing solutions and critical support across the enterprise for numerous systems and applications.  

The Synthetic Data Engine, or Simulation of the Nation (SimoN) is designed to generate volumes of synthetic tax data to represent a wide range of use cases, without copying Federal Tax Information (FTI) from production systems is an IRS directive.  SimoN is also able to age data to support multi-year tax code concerns for more comprehensive testing sequences spanning multiple tax years. This will improve the volume, diversity and quality of test data being created and processed in a systemic manner. To date, SimoN has produced over 700,000 unique and valid Individual Master File (IMF) tax returns, and over 50,000 unique and valid Business Master File (BMF) returns for testing. SimoN also supports Social Security Administration (SSA) interconnects and SS4 interconnects which allow the data produced to be fully linked between business and individuals. Over 320 dimensions of socioeconomic data are synthesized and validated against United States (U.S.) Census metrics to ensure a validated and realistic synthetic dataset. 

The SimoN solution consumes publicly available statistical data about businesses and the population of the U.S. This includes tax household composition, income and education levels and other data points. The solution combines statistical data with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to generate businesses and simulated households with a variety of tax scenarios. The solution then stores the business and population data in a database.  The data is extracted to files for submission to the test environment systems simulating eFile and SSA feeds with no review of data created.

At no point, is Production data (i.e., Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Federal Taxpayer Information (FTI) or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) used as input to the Artificial Intelligence/Machine Language (AI/ML) process of SimoN, nor does the simulated output data feed Production systems. In addition to generating synthetic data, this system is designed to simulate the aging of the population. The aging model includes a variety of socioeconomic events, such as births, deaths, marriages, job changes and address changes. SimoN also has multiple levels of automated testing and data validations to ensure the data produced is usable by IRS test systems and simulates businesses and population.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc:**: SimoN is capable of outputting 3 tax years of IMF and BMF returns starting in Tax Year 2022. With each XML Schema Definition (XSD) that is released under the Modernized e-File (MeF), SimoN implements each XSD version and provides full regression support for testing in successive years. Each XSD version has automated tests that run to ensure verifications can be run to reduce the likelihood of AI generated synthetic returns that might have data anomalies. 

Also, to help seed test systems with synthetic individuals and synthetic businesses, SimoN can output the Data Master 1 (DM1) file simulating a feed from Social Security Administration (SSA) and Application for Employer Identification Number file (Form SS-4) containing transcribed form information so that the test system can be initialized with the appropriate backend reference data for validation of IMF and BMF entities, as well as the ability to validate incoming synthetic tax returns.
