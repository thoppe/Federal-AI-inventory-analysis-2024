## DHS-2024-0039
_[Department of Homeland Security](<../3_agency/Department of Homeland Security.md>)_ (DHS) / CBP


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Entity resolution for ES multiple independent valid requirements that may be similar or able to be consolidated.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: "Uses machine learning and human input to leverage all data attributes to resolve entities, rather than traditional brute force rules
Automates process of unifying data sources and resolving entities at enterprise speed"
Product uses ML modeling to ingest multiple data sources and evolve models that associate disparate records to identify probable entities and/or identify commonalities between multiple independently submitted records. The automation of entity resolution within the models is supported by a tool that enables non-technical end users to continuously train models through a user-friendly interface.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Retired
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 10/1/2021
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 4/1/2022
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 10/1/2019
+ **Date when the AI use case was retired or began the process of retirement**: 11/30/2024
