+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: NARA plans to develop an AI-powered chat interface, similar to ChatGPT, that will allow users to easily explore its digital archives by asking questions in everyday language. This will make historical documents more accessible and engaging, leading to more efficient research and a deeper understanding of history.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: This AI will create a chat interface that lets users easily get information from NARA's archives by having a conversation with it.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Planned
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: TBD
