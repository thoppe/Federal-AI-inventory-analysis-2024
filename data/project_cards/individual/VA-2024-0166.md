+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Summarizing the key points of a lengthy report using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The VX insights hub provides a human-language interface to query aggregate-level / anonymized customer experience and operational metrics and data in support of VA performance improvement and decision-making. This tool leverages large language model interpretation and agents to write queries for structured and unstructured data, and articulate responses based on relevant source review or Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

This tool will empower VA staff in decision-making and performance improvement roles, who may not have a background in data science, statistics or analytics, to inquire about performance and experience and receive answers in plain language.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Natural language responses to CX and operations questions + validation information about the query that was written and run, etc.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 2/1/2024
