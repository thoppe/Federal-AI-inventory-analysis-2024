+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Statistical Methods
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: None
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The Compressed Large-scale Activity Scheduling and Planning (CLASP) project is a long-range scheduler for space-based or aerial instruments that can be modeled as pushbrooms 1D line sensors dragged across the surface of the body being observed. It addresses the problem of choosing the orientation and on/off times of a pushbroom instrument or collection of pushbroom instruments such that the schedule covers as many target points as possible, but without oversubscribing memory and energy. Orientation and time of observation is derived from geometric computations that CLASP performs using the SPICE ephemeris toolkit.  CLASP allows mission planning teams to start with a baseline mission concept and simulate the mission's science return using models of science observations, spacecraft operations, downlink, and spacecraft trajectory. This analysis can then be folded back into many aspects of mission design -- including trajectory, spacecraft design, operations concept, and downlink concept. The long planning horizons allow this analysis to span an entire mission.  Actively in use for optimized scheduling for the NISAR Mission, ECOSTRESS mission (study of water needs for plant areas), EMIT mission (mineralogy of arid dusty regions), OCO-3 (atmospheric CO2) and more as well as used for numerous missions analysis and studies (e.g. 100+).
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Estimates of scientific mission outcomes / results, based on optimized scheduling of spacecraft and sensors.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: In mission
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 1/1/2006
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 1/1/2006
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 1/1/2018
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with both contracting and in-house resources.
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: No
+ **Identification of the specific public-facing service that the AI use case supports**: None
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Description of how the agency is ensuring that this AI use case is compliant with Information Quality Act guidelines and OMB Memorandum M-19-15, if applicable**: NASA's data stewardship best practices are in effect under guidance from the Chief Data Officer.
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: No
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the rights datasets to begin model development**: Blank/Not Provided
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: Mission planning and execution data from multiple missions.
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Yes
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: No.  Engineering Review and Resease instead.
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: Deployed on multiple remote sensing spacecraft
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: This capability has been re-used among many missions
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Yes
