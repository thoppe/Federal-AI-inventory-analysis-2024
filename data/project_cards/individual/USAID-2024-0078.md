# HelloTask: multichannel job platform for blue-collar workers
## USAID-2024-0078
_[United States Agency for International Development](../3_agency/United States Agency for International Development.md)_ (USAID) / USAID/Bureau for Asia


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Diplomacy & Trade
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Under the Market Systems & Partnerships mechanism, USAID/Asia is supporting a partnership with HelloTask, a multichannel job platform for blue-collar workers that connects clients to care service providers (e.g., cooking, cleaning, laundry) via a smartphone application. As part of this activity, USAID is providing funding to support the development of an AI-based interactive voice response (IVR) technology that allows users to speak into their phones to interact with the job placement functions of the app.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The telephone-based IVR technology will allow lower-income users to better interface with the online technology platform to accept jobs and provide feedback. Users often do not have smartphones, but instead feature phones that have limited capability to support more sophisticated mobile apps often used by gig workers in other countries. The IVR system currently allows domestic workers to speak directly into their featurephones with the message being transcribed into the online tracking system. The next phase is to allow domestic workers to verbally accept and decline jobs, file feedback, and otherwise interact with the company in a way that is similar to other apps with gig employment.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 8/1/2023
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 3/1/2024
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with contracting resources.
+ **Identification of the Procurement Instrument Identifier(s) (PIID) of the contract(s) used for the AI use case**: 7200AA20C00054
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Yes
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is missing or not available: No documentation exists regarding maintenance, composition, quality, or intended use of the training and evaluation data.
+ **Identification of the demographic features explicitly utilized in the AI use case’s data/model(s), if any**: None
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: No
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: No
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: No
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Other
+ **Explanation for whether communication regarding the provisioning of requested resources for the AI use case has been timely**: No relevant resources
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: None: This use case does not re-use any internally developed tooling or managed infrastructure from any other AI development efforts within the agency.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: No documentation is available: No documentation detailing model performance metrics, model architecture, features and intended use of the models have been created or are currently accessible to other data science teams within the agency.
