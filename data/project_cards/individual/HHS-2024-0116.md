+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Provides custom reporting and analysis to meet the ongoing and emerging needs to address analytics and reporting needs and supports key business processes in the QPP cycle - such as delivering feedback to providers, calculating final scores, and delivering payment adjustments to the Medicare contractors.

The Admin Bot would benefit the program by increasing availability of data, thus empowering users and informing decisions, through a simple-to-use communication platform.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Powered by Amazon Bedrock, the out-of-the-box solution can interface directly with data lakes like QPP's Universal Data Set (UDS) empowering users to ask very pointed questions on model data and/or model performance.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 8/1/2024
