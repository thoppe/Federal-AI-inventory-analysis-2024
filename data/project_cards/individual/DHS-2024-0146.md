+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Eliminates the manual burden and reduces errors in document creation, where staff previously spent excessive time writing requirements to meet specific procurement needs from scratch. Increases documentation accuracy, consistency and standardization. Improves management and verification of requirement documents. Cost savings represent another major benefit, as the platform reduces labor costs associated with manual document creation and management. By streamlining the procurement process, the agency can complete more procurement actions with existing resources, maximizing taxpayer dollars. The automated tool also reduces the time spent on repetitive tasks, allowing for better resource allocation.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The tool primarily outputs automated document generation and recommendations for procurement documentation. The platform provides contextual recommendations during the document creation process to ensure completeness and compliance with procurement requirements. The tool provides recommendations and decision support to guide users through the proper documentation structure and content requirements.
The system's outputs always require human verification as part of the workflow, ensuring that all generated content is reviewed and approved by qualified personnel before being finalized in the procurement process.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is testing a contract documentation platform, Carver, to streamline the creation, management, and generation of requirement documentation for purchase request documents. The tool leverages AI technologies like large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) for automation. Based on user inputs, the system generates and manages standard language for key documents, such as Statements of Work (SOW), Performance Work Statements (PWS), and Statements of Objectives (SOO). 

The tool attempts to provide the TSA user with contextually accurate outputs (primarily in the form of automated document generation and recommendations for procurement documentation) tailored to specific requirements. The platform provides contextual recommendations during the document creation process to ensure completeness and compliance with procurement requirements. The tool provides recommendations and decision support to guide users through the proper documentation structure and content requirements. 

This will significantly reduce manual effort and errors in document creation while improving accuracy, consistency, compliance, and efficiency. By streamlining the procurement process, the agency can complete more procurement actions with existing resources, maximizing taxpayer dollars. The automated tool also reduces the time spent on manual or repetitive tasks (e.g., manual document creation and management), allowing for better resource allocation. The system's outputs always require human verification as part of the workflow, ensuring that all generated content is reviewed and approved by qualified personnel before being finalized in the procurement process.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 4/1/2024
