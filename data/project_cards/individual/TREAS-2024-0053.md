+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Digitizing text from scanned documents or smart forms for archival purposes using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: In support of the microfilm conversion process for Mature Undredeemed Debt/SavingsBonds, the Fiscal Vendor, Iron Mountain, has incorporated a focus on the application of AI and deep learning ML to maximize processing efficiency and accuracy of results.  The solution leverages these technologies to continually optimize output and ultimately our return on investment.  Iron Mountain's solution uses AI/ML to make data more accessible and enabled Fiscal Service to establish the abilit to search the data and identify bond owners.  To date, 175,000 reels of film have been digitized for approximately 2.1B images that are ultimately stored in Azure cloud tenant.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Image Files
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Implementation and Assessment
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
