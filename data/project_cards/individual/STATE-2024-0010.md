+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Other; Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Consular Affairs
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: To measure and understand causal impacts of consular service changes and improvements on desired outcomes (e.g., efficiency, effectiveness, customer and employee experiences, actionable behaviors, etc.) using methods such as machine learning and statistical modeling. This will allow Consular Affairs to better predict how these service changes will impact customers and employees before they are implemented.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Improved outcomes.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
