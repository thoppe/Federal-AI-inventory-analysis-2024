+ **Title of the AI use case:**: Normalization Services
+ **Agency responsible for the AI use case:**: Department of Homeland Security
+ **Agency abbreviation:**: DHS
+ **Specific organization(s) within the agency responsible for the AI use case:**: ICE
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: Law & Justice
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: 
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B:**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public:**: HSI utilizes artificial intelligence to enhance data accuracy and efficiency by verifying, validating, correcting, and normalizing various types of information, including addresses, phone numbers, names, and ID numbers. This process helps to eliminate data entry errors, detect intentional misidentification, and connect related information across multiple datasets, ultimately reducing the time and resources required for investigations. The machine learning-powered normalization services offered by HSI include converting ambiguous addresses into usable formats, identifying ID types from partial information, categorizing names with complex suffixes and family names, and standardizing phone numbers to the E164 format, including determining their originating county. By normalizing and improving the quality of investigative datasets, HSI is able to use more advanced tools to find correlations and leads that would have otherwise gone undetected without extensive manual effort.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc:**: The output includes normalized data that improves search capability during investigations. This includes normalizing data to update less well-defined addresses into usable addresses for analysis- (such as those using mile markers instead of a street number); inferring ID type based on user-provided ID value (such as distinguishing a SSN from a DL number without additional context); categorizing name parts while taking into account additional factors (including generational suffixes and multi-part family names); and validating and normalizing phone numbers to the E164 standard, including their identified county of origin.
Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is a critical component of ICE, responsible for investigating a wide range of crimes that threaten national security, public safety, and the economy. With a mission to protect the United States from transnational crime and terrorism, HSI works to disrupt and dismantle complex organizations that engage in human trafficking, narcotics smuggling, cybercrime, and other illicit activities. To achieve this mission, HSI relies on advanced technologies and innovative solutions to analyze and process vast amounts of data, including audio and video evidence.
