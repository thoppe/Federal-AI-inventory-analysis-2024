+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Education & Workforce
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The CAPS-5 Clinician Training Simulator comprises three online courses, available in TMS and TRAIN, that provide instruction in the administration and scoring of the CAPS-5. The courses use voice recognition, 3-D technology, and artificial intelligence to create an immersive learning experience. The courses are intended for clinicians, trainees, researchers, and examiners in VA and in the community. They use AI in the following ways: 1. In the three current CAPS-5 virtual patient courses, learners have the option to speak the prompts, with their spoken prompts transformed to text using speech recognition. 2. The learners’ prompts, whether spoken or typed, are programmatically compared to the required prompts in the CAPS-5. The system analyzes whether the prompts were delivered exactly (“verbatim”), with slight variations (“paraphrased”), or with unacceptable variations (“off-script”). 3. One of the courses analyzes learner prompts in order to trigger comments –corrections or praise -- from a virtual coach. 4. We’re currently revising one of the courses to use generative AI. Here’s how the vendor described it in their response to our solicitation: “This new design will also leverage a separate backend to handle AI multi-agency and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to ensure large language models (LLMs) used will always operate as designed.” This will be a closed system that does not pull information from or input information to publicly-available platforms (e.g., GPT-4, Bard). More information about the three courses and access to them is available at https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/continuing_ed/caps5_clinician_training.asp.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The AI system outputs, narrowly defined, are the virtual patients' responses to the learners' prompts. More broadly, the system is designed to help learners learn to more accurately administer and score the CAPS-5. Learners receive a summary document describing their performance at the conclusion of each course.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Operation and Maintenance
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 10/15/2018
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 11/29/2018
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 3/13/2020
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with contracting resources.
+ **Identification of the Procurement Instrument Identifier(s) (PIID) of the contract(s) used for the AI use case**: 3610G8Q9155
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: No
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: No
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: Yes – agency has access to source code, but it is not public.
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: No
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: No
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: No
+ **Has the communication been timely**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: None: This use case does not re-use any internally developed tooling or managed infrastructure from any other AI development efforts within the agency.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: No documentation is available: No documentation detailing model performance metrics, model architecture, features and intended use of the models have been created or are currently accessible to other data science teams within the agency.
