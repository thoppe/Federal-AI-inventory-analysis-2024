+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Enable improvement of data quality and coverage not acheivable without AI automation given current staffing resources: (1) Filling gaps in summary data, (2) Adding audio/video transcripts (with summaries) (3) Adding descriptions to images.
