## VA-2024-0063
_[Department of Veterans Affairs](../3_agency/Department of Veterans Affairs.md)_ (VA) / VHA: Veterans Health Administration


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Health & Medical
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Functional Overview: The objective is to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) with comment reviews for App feedback, specifically to identify named entities (NER), profanity, and stop words, and provide an automated approach to pre-processing and cleaning text for downstream analytics tools.
 
System Overview: The system uses spaCy's en_core_web_sm model, an open-source software and model, to analyze text reviews from various sources, including external sources (Google and Apple stores) and internal sources (FeedbackUI and VA Mobile). The model provides an out-of-the-box approach for NLP tasks, including NER, profanity detection, and stop word removal.
 
Data: The data sources include:
 
Text reviews from the VA's mobile applications on the Google and Apple stores (external sources)

Reviews from FeedbackUI (internal source, available in the OIA_MobileHealth database)

Reviews from VA Mobile (internal source, available via CSV files on the Mobile VA's internal website)

Users: The users of this system are likely the OCC Data Science Team, who are responsible for developing and maintaining the pipeline.
 
Target Audience: The target audience mobile application developers and other internal stakeholders who may be interested in analyzing and understanding the sentiment and feedback from these reviews.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The objective is to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) with comment reviews for App feedback, specifically to identify named entities (NER), profanity, and stop words, and provide an automated approach to pre-processing and cleaning text for downstream analytics tools.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Operation and Maintenance
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 12/1/2022
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 2/1/2024
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 4/26/2024
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with contracting resources.
+ **Identification of the Procurement Instrument Identifier(s) (PIID) of the contract(s) used for the AI use case**: Unable to identify in time, working with Contracting team to identify. Iron Bow (Prime) - InnoVet (Sub)
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Yes
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: CDW -VA application feedback data (Ex. Share My Health Data - application download count, user review)
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is missing or not available: No documentation exists regarding maintenance, composition, quality, or intended use of the training and evaluation data.
+ **Identification of the demographic features explicitly utilized in the AI use case’s data/model(s), if any**: ["Other"]
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: Yes – agency has access to source code, but it is not public.
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: SDP / HDAP - working with contract team to better identify system nomenclature this falls under
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: Less than 6 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: Use of existing data platforms: This use case is being developed on existing enterprise data and analytics platforms within the agency rather than procuring additional platforms or SaaS to operate.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: No documentation is available: No documentation detailing model performance metrics, model architecture, features and intended use of the models have been created or are currently accessible to other data science teams within the agency.
