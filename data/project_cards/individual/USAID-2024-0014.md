+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Diplomacy & Trade
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The Xylotron, created by the U.S. Forest Service's Forest Products Laboratory, uses artificial intelligence to rapidly identify wood species with the goal to identify timber prohibited from logging under national law or the Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES).
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The Xylotron uses AI to identify the timber species in a sample by matching a scanned image with the database of DNA data. The research team added 35 Peruvian species to the Xylotron's database as part of this research project.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Retired
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case was retired or began the process of retirement**: 12/1/2021
