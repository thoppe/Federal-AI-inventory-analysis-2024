+ **Title of the AI use case:**: Sidekick Comms bot Offering User-friendly Tips (SCOUT)
+ **Agency responsible for the AI use case:**: Department of Health and Human Services
+ **Agency abbreviation:**: HHS
+ **Specific organization(s) within the agency responsible for the AI use case:**: CDC
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: 
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B:**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public:**: The AI will impact the content creation processes for CDC.GOV and reduce burden in creating new webpages. CDC sometimes uses GenAI (generative artificial intelligence) to help create content for the public. This may include content for the web, social media, fact sheets, and graphics. In every case, our experts review our communication materials in an effort to ensure accuracy and quality before use. CDC public health research, data, and recommendations are based on the best science currently available and go through a separate agency review process prior to release.

The solution aims to reduce the workload of health communicators by simplifying the process of creating new web pages and social media posts. By leveraging Generative AI technology, we can produce new content much more quickly than if communications staff were to do it on their own. The goal is to make the published content more accessible and understandable for the general public, ensuring that CDC information reaches a wider audience. It's important to note that all content generated by the AI is carefully reviewed and edited by a human before it is used and the follow disclaimer is stated with public content that this tool has been used with: "CDC sometimes uses GenAI (generative artificial intelligence) to help create content for the public.

+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc:**: CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion use of Generative AI in this use case is to help convert existing web content into plain and clear language. This solution uses Gen AI to create new versions of publicly available content that are easier for end-users to understand. By incorporating prompts, the tool makes the content more suitable for a general lay audience. In addition to web articles, the Generative AI tool also allows for the creation of social media posts. The goal of this project is to make information more accessible by providing plain language content on various platforms.
