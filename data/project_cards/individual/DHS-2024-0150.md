+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Transportation
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) uses AI-based, one-to-one (1:1) facial matching technologies at some checkpoints to assist human reviewers with traveler identity verification. The purpose and expected benefits of the technology include increased speed and accuracy of identity verification at the checkpoint while improving detection of imposters.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The system produces an recommendation to the Transportation Security Officer (TSO) to indicate if person presenting the identity document is similar to the face on the photo ID document.  In the event of a non-match, the TSO is responsible for additional identity verification steps to verify the identity of the traveler.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) uses one-to-one (1:1) facial matching technologies at some checkpoints to assist human reviewers with traveler identity verification. These systems temporarily capture an image of a traveler who chooses to use the screening method and then utilizes biometric technology to match the traveler to the identity document they have presented at the checkpoint. No images are retained by TSA, and the voluntary process increases speed and improves accuracy of identity verification by the human reviewer at the checkpoint.
