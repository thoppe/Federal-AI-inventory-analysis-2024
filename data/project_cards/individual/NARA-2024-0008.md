+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: NARA plans to use AI to automatically create descriptions for its digital objects. This will free up archivists' time and make it easier for people to find and understand the digital materials in NARA's system.
