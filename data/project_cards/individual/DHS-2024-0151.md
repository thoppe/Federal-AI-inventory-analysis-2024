## DHS-2024-0151
_[Department of Homeland Security](<../3_agency/Department of Homeland Security.md>)_ (DHS) / TSA


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Transportation
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: TSA is using Facial Comparison to verify a passenger’s identity at its security checkpoints and CMAP locations using the CBP Traveler Verification Service (TVS). This process streamlines passenger and crewmember identity verification, increasing the speed of security checks while maintaining a high degree of safety for all passengers and crewmembers."
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: TSA is leveraging CBP's TVS system technology as an optional process for passengers or crew members traveling via certain airports who wish to further expedite their TSA PreCheck or crew member ID verification process. This additional TSA PreCheck feature is voluntary, and passengers may opt-out of the process at any time and instead choose the standard identity verification by a Transportation Security Officer (TSO). Crew members that wish to opt-out will be sent to the security checkpoint to process through screening.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) uses one-to-many (1:n) facial identification technologies as an optional process at some checkpoints to assist human reviewers with traveler identity verification. This additional TSA PreCheck feature is voluntary, and passengers may opt-out of the process at any time and instead choose the standard identity verification by a Transportation Security Officer (TSO). These systems temporarily capture an image of a traveler who chooses to use the screening method and then cross references Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP’s) Traveler Verification Service (TVS) to compare the passenger’s live image to a gallery of pre-staged, enrolled reference photos. No images are retained by TSA, and the voluntary process increases speed and improves accuracy of identity verification by the human reviewer at the checkpoint.

+ **Identification of the reasonably foreseeable risks from using the AI use case, to include the risk of inequitable outcomes for individuals. This can be informed by publicly known risks identified in similar use cases or contexts. Examples of such risks include at least physical injury, emotional/psychological injury, opportunity loss, economic loss, privacy loss, environmental impact, or civil rights and civil liberties impact**: The key risk is the degradation of the TVS verification to degrade overtime based on the parameters of assessment for comparing images to templates. This was mitigated by testing the threshold for the biometric matching extensively with a variety of face types for several months to establish a match threshold for the identification. The algorithms have been trained on hundreds of millions of data points from a combination of public and private data sources. The underlying data covers a wide variety of demographics (e.g., age, race, gender, etc.) representative of the general population. During model training and refinement shortcomings (e.g., certain combinations of flesh tones and lighting, facial hair variations, etc.) were compensated for. The algorithms are industry leading as measured by NIST. This mitigates the risk of poor performance and algorithmic discrimination.
+ **Whether an independent evaluation of the AI use case has been conducted through the CAIO, an agency AI oversight board, or other appropriate agency office with existing test and evaluation responsibilities, consistent with Section 5(c)(iv)(C) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. The independent reviewing authority must not have been directly involved in the AI system’s development**: Yes – by the CAIO
+ **Whether there’s an established process for monitoring performance of the AI system’s functionality and changes to its impact on rights and/or safety, including, if relevant, the risk of AI-enabled discrimination, consistent with Section 5(c)(iv)(D) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Intermittent and Manually Updated: A plan for monitoring the AI use case is in place, and requires data science teams to work with DevOps engineers to manually update models at scheduled intervals, and create metrics to detect data distribution shifts between the operational environment and the training data for the model.
+ **Whether the agency has determined that the AI can carry out its individual core decisions or actions that could result in a significant impact on rights and safety without direct human involvement. The answer should not be “yes” if humans are not reviewing individual decisions and are only overseeing or reviewing the performance of the system in general**: No - Some individual decisions or actions require direct human oversight.
