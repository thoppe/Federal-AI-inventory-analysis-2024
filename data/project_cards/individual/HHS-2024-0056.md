# Using Generative AI for Stance Analysis of Public Comments on CDC’s Proposed Rules
## HHS-2024-0056
_Department of Health and Human Services_ (HHS) / CDC


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: By law, Public comments are required to be manually review for any notice of public rule making. These comments are highly labor intensive due to both the quantity and wide range of potential opinions shared by the public. These comments can range in both length of response and quantity serving as a challenge for properly ensuring the insights from the public are accurately gathered in the review process. By using an LLM based Topic Modeling approach, manual reviewers can organize responses based upon theme to enhance both the insights gained, the speed of manual review, and ensure all topics mentioned can be accurately reported in all review processes. This process can use open source python libraries and open-source LLMs to complete different actions.

 As public feedback on various rules gets collected across the CDC’s divisions, this initiative along with other NLP approaches can potentially save time for CDC’s public policy experts during public comment review.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Reviewing the public comments currently involves a manual review process that necessitates a high level of time and effort on the part of regulatory analysts. To improve the process of reviewing public comments as part of regulatory analysis, our team implemented topic modeling (Grootendorst et al., 2022) and sentiment analysis (Hartman et al., 2023) of comments published to the new amendment to foreign quarantine regulation published by CDC on July 10, 2023. This solution expands these efforts by using generative AI models  to try for capture stance expressed in each comment. While there is also an option to manually label and train models for stance detection, custom-trained text classification models may not be transferable to future rules due to rule-specific discussions and arguments. In contrast, using generative AI models for stance detection can be transferable to future rules irrespective of the discussion contexts and arguments.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Implementation and Assessment
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 7/1/2023
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 7/1/2023
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed in-house.
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: No
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: No
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is missing or not available
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: Yes – agency has access to source code, but it is not public.
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: No
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: Less than 6 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: Use of existing data platforms: This use case is being developed on existing enterprise data and analytics platforms within the agency rather than procuring additional platforms or SaaS to operate.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Limited documentation for review: Some information regarding the model’s performance on specific benchmarks are available or have been shared with specific stakeholders within the agency.
