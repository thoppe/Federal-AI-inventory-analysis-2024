This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor:**: We utilized agency-owned data for training and evaluating the model's performance. The data consisted of clinical study record submissions from ClinicalTrials.gov's Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) that were divided into two groups:

Set A: This group included submissions that did not pass quality control review, meaning they were returned to data submitters for revision and, in certain cases, are versions of the record that were never posted on ClinicalTrials.gov (not accessible to the public). These submissions had a relevant issue identified during manual quality control review, providing examples of endpoints known to contain the specific issue.

Set B: This group included submissions that were posted on ClinicalTrials.gov with endpoints that had never been labeled as having the specific issue. These submissions provided examples of endpoints that were considered not to have the specific issue.The input to the classifiers consisted of endpoint attributes, including Measure Titles, Descriptions, Time Frames, Units of Measure, and labels indicating whether the issue was present. This data did not have any personal identifiers. The data was in a structured format in the PRS, but the specific endpoint attributes were provided as free-text.

We processed over 10,000 endpoints from Set A, which included examples with identified issues, and over 40,000 endpoints from Set B, which had not been flagged with issues. It is important to note that the labeling of issues in the dataset is not exhaustive. Some endpoints may present multiple issues combined and labeled as a single issue, and there is a possibility that some issues were missed by reviewers. Consequently, Set B might contain endpoints that actually have the issue despite not being labeled as such.
