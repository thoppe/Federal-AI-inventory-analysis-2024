+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Leverages a commercial constellation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites with readily available data, capable of imaging any location on Earth, day, and night, regardless of cloud cover. Utilizes AI, including machine vision, object, detection, object recognition, and annotation to detect airframes, military vehicles, and marine vessels, as well as built-in change detection capabilities for disaster response missions.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: This use case is inactive. Please see the "intended purpose and expected benefits" for a full description of this use case.
