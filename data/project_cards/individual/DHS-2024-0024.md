+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Faster and more accurate creation of PDs, reducing admin burden on field and HQs as well as HR specialists, allowing agency to get more done with less staff.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Creation of accurate position descriptions, verified by Human Resources Specialists
Incorporation of large langue models (LLMs) into the position description (PD) classification process, will enable accurate, speedy classification services delivery, increase uniformity in the classification process, and enable more robust PD language, leading to a more accurate assessment and ultimately a better applicant pool and candidate. Accurate PDs will also reduce the risk of PD based litigation or grievance against the agency. The system- created accurate PDs will be verified by Human Resources Specialist while reducing the administrative burden, allowing the agency to accomplish more with less staff.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 11/8/2024
