# AI to Improve Public Access to the Administrative Appeals Process
## HHS-2024-0145
_Department of Health and Human Services_ (HHS) / DAB


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The DAB adjudicates  disputes under more than 60 statutory authorities.  The workload is divided between the DAB's four adjudicatory divisions (e.g., the Board, the Civil Remedies Division, the Medicare Operations Division and the Alternative Disputes Resolution Division. Helping appellants decide which entity within the DAB is responsible for adjudicating their appeal will increase efficiency in adjudication and customer experience. 

The DAB's appellant community (e.g., e-file users) will be provided immediate assistance and accurate information; deaf and hard-of-hearing populations and individuals with limited English proficiency are helped without the use of intermediaries, such as interpreters, translators, and relay services. After determining the appropriate division within the DAB responsible for adjudicating the appeal, the Chatbot can provide a link to the e-file website directly connecting the user to the correct e-file system.  Other benefits include: Improve public access to the appeals process by providing instant, accurate and complete filing information; Increase the DAB's productivity by refocusing the workforce to case resolution instead of responding the filing inquires and processing and appropriately routing misfiled appeals; and Improve resource allocation based on each Division's actual workload.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: A chatbot on the DAB's website can direct filers to the correct Division and e-file system with which the appeal should be filed by using natural language processing (e.g., questions and responses) with the ability to further refine and increase accuracy based on user response.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 4/1/2023
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 7/1/2023
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed in-house.
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Yes
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: None
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is complete
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: DAB E-file
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: More than 12 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: Use of existing data platforms: This use case is being developed on existing enterprise data and analytics platforms within the agency rather than procuring additional platforms or SaaS to operate.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Documentation has been developed: Complete documentation detailing model performance across a range of benchmarks, architecture, relevant features and information regarding the appropriate use of the model for predictive tasks has been created.
