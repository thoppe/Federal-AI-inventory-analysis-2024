+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: AI tool to help perform initial analysis of the incoming 9141 and 9089 applications. Make initial determinations regarding whether issuance of a Request for Information is necessary. Create a standard RFI request and either (1) automatically issue the RFI before case assignment and hopefully obtain customer responses by the time the case is assigned OR (2) perform this action at case assignment and allow the assignment analyst to affirm and issue the RFI or not.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Flag cases for RFI
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 5/21/2024
