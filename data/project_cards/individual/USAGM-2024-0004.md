+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: This initiative uses AI integrated with our content management system (CMS) to streamline multilingual content production across USAGM’s networks. Unlike typical translation tasks, USAGM faces the unique challenge of efficiently translating content into 50-plus languages, spanning diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. The AI translation tool provides draft translations for cloned articles, enabling seamless content reuse between language teams while maintaining accuracy and cultural sensitivity. This solution is critical for ensuring high-quality, localized content delivery to audiences worldwide.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
