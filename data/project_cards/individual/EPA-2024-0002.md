+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Energy & the Environment
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Summarizing the key points of a lengthy report using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The program has 20 years of help requests and responses in a customized open source help desk tool. We are mapping out a transition to Jira Service Desk but are not able to easily import 20 years of knowledge and answers to common questions. The project team plans to use generative AI to categorize questions and summarize responses. These outputs would serve as the knowledge base for the new help desk.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Knowledge base to populate the new help desk system:
- Common questions
- Categories of questions
- Responses
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
