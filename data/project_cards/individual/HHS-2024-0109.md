+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Education & Workforce
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Continue to assess and refine content present in both the informational public side of QPP, Resource Library, Webinar Library, and Top Navigation as the site continues to grow.

The Chat Client would benefit the program by improving user experience through easier access to information, increased program understanding, and ability to communicate in multiple languages.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Powered by Amazon Bedrock, by loading all resources, files, references etc. available to the QPP user community, we can establish a knowledge base that allows the bot to scan all available program documentation to construct a message that accurately answers a user's question.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 8/1/2024
