+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Science & Space
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The AI, CALLM (Climate Action through Large Language Models), addresses the problem of communicating complex climate projections and scientific literature to a broad audience, particularly electric sector stakeholders. It simplifies this information to help these stakeholders identify climate resilience solutions.

Expected benefits include improved communication of climate science, empowering stakeholders to directly address climate change impacts, and accelerating the scalability of ClimRR (presumably an existing Argonne tool) to serve a wider range of users. This ultimately leads to more effective climate resilience planning and potentially cost savings through better informed decision-making.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The AI output of CALLM is information synthesized from complex climate projections and scientific literature, presented in a simplified and accessible format. This output helps users understand potential climate impacts and identify appropriate climate resilience solutions. The information is grounded in vetted data and published research to minimize inaccuracies and hallucinations common in large language models. The output could range from summaries of climate-related risks, to lists of potential adaptation strategies tailored to specific situations, depending on the user's input and the function of the system it's integrated with (like ClimRR).
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 8/26/2024
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 10/1/2024
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed in-house.
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: No
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: The Climate Action through Large Language Models (CALLM) tool utilizes vetted climate data and published climate resilience literature to train, fine-tune, and evaluate its performance. The specific datasets are not detailed here, but the approach emphasizes the use of established climate science information to ground the model's responses and mitigate inaccuracies.
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: No
