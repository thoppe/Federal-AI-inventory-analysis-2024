## HHS-2024-0068
_[Department of Health and Human Services](../3_agency/Department of Health and Human Services.md)_ (HHS) / CDC


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: CDC has an internal productivity tool available to all CDC staff which can be used in a variety of ways. This use case covers staff who will be using this general purpose to assist with the development of software code which can be used for research, data analysis, software development, or other such systems. Currently, CDC has internal Generative AI guidance determining how this tool can be used, and individual Centers, institutes, or Offices may implement their own policy to ensure safe and responsible AI. 

When the AI chatbot is being used for coding assistance or software development, it affects several business processes related to agency operations and core task structures. Specifically, it can be utilized by various personnel within an organization such as the CDC, including software programmers using AI-specific code, those involved in encoding for software development, data analysts, scientific researchers conducting data analysis, data scientists implementing and testing new models, and software engineers developing or updating applications.
The chatbot enhances productivity and efficiency across these roles by providing coding assistance and acting as a learning tool. For instance, data engineers may use the chatbot to generate PySpark code for their data transformation scripts within a larger pipeline. Additionally, individuals new to programming languages like Python can leverage the chatbot as a tutor to help them with tasks such as cleaning up datasets for evaluation purposes.
In summary, the AI chatbot impacts business processes by aiding staff members in performing complex analytical tasks more efficiently and supporting their development work through guided coding assistance. This ultimately contributes to enhancing overall operations within the agency by streamlining research activities and internal process workflows.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: This chatbot, powered by Azure OpenAI Large Language Models, will generate responses to questions asked by the user, in this case about either some software code, software code documentation, code concepts, or to help generate software code. The chatbot's output can then be copied and pasted or manually entered into the appropriate testing process by the staff to ensure any code used from the chatbot's output meets the criteria of the current task.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Operation and Maintenance
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 10/1/2023
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 11/1/2023
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 2/1/2024
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with both contracting and in-house resources.
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: No
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: No
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: Yes. A series of pilot projects was conducted to evaluate the performance of this chatbot and these pilot projects are included within this inventory.
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is widely available
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: Yes – agency has access to source code, but it is not public.
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: Enterprise Data Analytics and Visualization (EDAV) Platform
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: Less than 6 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: Use of existing data platforms: This use case is being developed on existing enterprise data and analytics platforms within the agency rather than procuring additional platforms or SaaS to operate.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Documentation has been published: Complete documentation has been published to a repository or data catalog within the agency and is made accessible to other data science teams for review and feedback.
