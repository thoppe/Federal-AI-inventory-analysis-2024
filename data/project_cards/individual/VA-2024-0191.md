+ **Title of the AI use case:**: Implementation of a Severe COVID-19 Risk Prediction Tool
+ **Agency responsible for the AI use case:**: Department of Veterans Affairs
+ **Agency abbreviation:**: VA
+ **Specific organization(s) within the agency responsible for the AI use case:**: VHA: Veterans Health Administration
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: Health & Medical

+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B:**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public:**: The project seeks to implement a Severe COVID-19 Risk Prediction Tool to effectively identify Veterans at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms through a machine-learning model to address one of the key barriers to increased vaccination offerings identified, i.e., the lack of tools for assessing risk of severe disease progression and potential vaccination benefit. It is expected by facilitating the estimated risk for severe COVID-19 progression, as well as a patient's current vaccine eligibility, that these patients can be outreached to and offered the vaccine in a more timely manner to improve vaccination rates and ultimately health outcomes.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc:**: The model will output a relative risk score for currently hospitalized patients based on their COVID-19 progression severity risk, and will generate a task notification to clinical teams to notify them of patients within that cohort output who also currently meet eligibility for receiving the COVID vaccine based on CDC guidelines (i.e. no recent history of already receiving vaccine, or recent COVID-19 infection).
