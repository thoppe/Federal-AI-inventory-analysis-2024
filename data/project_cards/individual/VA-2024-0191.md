# Implementation of a Severe COVID-19 Risk Prediction Tool
## VA-2024-0191
_[Department of Veterans Affairs](<../3_agency/Department of Veterans Affairs.md>)_ (VA) / VHA: Veterans Health Administration


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Health & Medical
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The project seeks to implement a Severe COVID-19 Risk Prediction Tool to effectively identify Veterans at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms through a machine-learning model to address one of the key barriers to increased vaccination offerings identified, i.e., the lack of tools for assessing risk of severe disease progression and potential vaccination benefit. It is expected by facilitating the estimated risk for severe COVID-19 progression, as well as a patient's current vaccine eligibility, that these patients can be outreached to and offered the vaccine in a more timely manner to improve vaccination rates and ultimately health outcomes.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The model will output a relative risk score for currently hospitalized patients based on their COVID-19 progression severity risk, and will generate a task notification to clinical teams to notify them of patients within that cohort output who also currently meet eligibility for receiving the COVID vaccine based on CDC guidelines (i.e. no recent history of already receiving vaccine, or recent COVID-19 infection).
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Both
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 3/1/2024
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 3/1/2024
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with both contracting and in-house resources.
+ **Identification of the Procurement Instrument Identifier(s) (PIID) of the contract(s) used for the AI use case**: Contract Number: GS-35F-0086U Contract Order Number: 36C10B21F0353
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: Yes
+ **Identification of the High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) that the AI use case supports**: Veterans Health Administration
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Yes
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: VA data input variables for this model were adapted from prior work done at VA Boston through Office of Research / IRB work, and included: Time since infection prior to vaccination Use of glucocorticoids Lymphocyte levels Presence of various comorbidities including:  -Alzheimer's Disease -Anemia -Atrial fibrillation -Chronic Kidney Disease -Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -Epilepsy -Heart failure -Liver disease -Mobility impairments -Pressure and chronic ulcers -Acute myocardial infarction -Hypertension -Lung Cancer -Schizophrenia Tobacco use Body Mass Index categorization  -Extreme Obesity -Obesity I / Obesity II -Overweight -Unknown -Underweight Vaccine type (manufacturer) Age group
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is complete: Documentation exists regarding the maintenance, composition, quality, and intended use of the training and evaluation data, as well as any statistical bias across model features and protected groups.
+ **Identification of the demographic features explicitly utilized in the AI use case’s data/model(s), if any**: ["Age","Sex/Gender","Other"]
+ **Identification of the other demographic features explicitly utilized in the AI use case’s data/model(s), if any**: Mobility impairment
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: Yes – agency has access to source code, but it is not public.
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: Corporate Data Warehouse (VASI ID #1152)
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: 6-12 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: No
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: No
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: Use of existing data platforms: This use case is being developed on existing enterprise data and analytics platforms within the agency rather than procuring additional platforms or SaaS to operate.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Limited documentation for review: Some information regarding the model’s performance on specific benchmarks are available or have been shared with specific stakeholders within the agency.
