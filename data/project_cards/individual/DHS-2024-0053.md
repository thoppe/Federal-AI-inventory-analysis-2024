# Mobile Traveler Identity Verification
## DHS-2024-0053
_Department of Homeland Security_ (DHS) / CBP


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Law & Justice
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The TVS Biometric matching service is a cloud-based facial biometric matching service that enables CBP to match a passenger’s identity against a trusted source, throughout the travel continuum which improves traveler facilitation and reduces manual identity verification
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Provides a match or no match response
CBP uses facial recognition technology for process efficiency under the Visa Waiver system, using Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) Mobile, and in identifying arriving travelers at airports of entry, using Mobile Passport Control. ESTA Mobile is an application and screening system used to determine whether citizens and nationals from countries participating in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) are eligible to travel to the United States. ESTA Mobile extends the functionality to mobile platforms. The ESTA Mobile application captures a live photo from the traveler to perform a liveness test, and permit CBP’s TVS to conduct a 1-to-1 comparison of the traveler’s captured photo against the traveler’s passport e-Chip photo. ESTA mobile app users may either be an applicant, or third-party affiliates may complete an ESTA authorization on behalf of the traveler. If the ESTA Mobile output does not find liveness or cannot determine an identity match, the application can move forward through the ESTA website, simply treating it as filed by a third-party applicant. Mobile Passport Control captures lives photos of a traveler to permit CBP’s TVS to compare the photo to verified identifies compiled in flight galleries. This allows traveler to verify their identity using their mobile device. If a traveler is unsuccessful with mobile passport control, the traveler is simply processed in the regular customs line. 
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Operation and Maintenance
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 6/1/2017
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 9/1/2017
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 1/1/2022
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with contracting resources.
+ **Identification of the Procurement Instrument Identifier(s) (PIID) of the contract(s) used for the AI use case**: 024-000005265
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: Yes
+ **Identification of the High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) that the AI use case supports**: Customs and Border Protection
+ **Identification of the specific public-facing service that the AI use case supports**: Enabling trusted travelers to enter the country quickly with Global Entry (GE)
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Yes
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: Border Crossing Information/ Trusted Traveler Information
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation has been partially completed: Some documentation exists (detailing the composition and any statistical bias or measurement skew for training and evaluation purposes), but documentation took place within this use case’s development.
+ **Identification of the demographic features explicitly utilized in the AI use case’s data/model(s), if any**: None
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: Yes – agency has access to source code, but it is not public.
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: Traveler Verification Service
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: Less than 6 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: None: This use case does not re-use any internally developed tooling or managed infrastructure from any other AI development efforts within the agency.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Documentation has been developed: Complete documentation detailing model performance across a range of benchmarks, architecture, relevant features and information regarding the appropriate use of the model for predictive tasks has been created.
