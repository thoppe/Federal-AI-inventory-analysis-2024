+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Health & Medical
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: USAID-supported Momentum Country and Global Leadership (MCGL) - project led by Jhpiego, focuses on innovative digital solutions to ensure compliance with WHO-recommended “Nine steps for correct handwashing techniques”. MCGL has developed SafeHands - an Artificial Intelligence tool to monitor and improve facility-level hand hygiene. SafeHands uses AI algorithms to closely watch the movement of palms and fingers in real-time, checks for the handwashing steps prescribed by WHO and measures the time duration for the rubbing action with the soap.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Video annotations
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Retired
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case was retired or began the process of retirement**: 7/14/1905
