+ **Title of the AI use case:**: User Entity and Behavior Analytics (UEBA) for Security Operations (SecOps) Anomaly Identification
+ **Agency responsible for the AI use case:**: Department of Homeland Security
+ **Agency abbreviation:**: DHS
+ **Specific organization(s) within the agency responsible for the AI use case:**: USCIS
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: Mission-Enabling
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: 
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B:**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public:**: UEBA's purpose is to review USCIS system logs to determine when an entity is performing actions that are anomalous. An entity can be classified as a workstation, server or an internal USCIS system account. The UEBA ingests logs from systems to perform analytics based off of models that are manually created and maintained. UEBA uses the models to apply a risk score to the entity which the risk score is then used to create a case (or ticket) for Security Operations analyst review. The AI reviews the action of the analyst to adjust the risk scoring for future events. Output would assist in prioritizing cyber events for further manual investigation.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc:**: Output of the Machine Learning is an alert with all artifacts for the SOC to investigate. The alert is used as a recommendation to prioritize specific investigations in the SOC ticket queue.
User Entity and Behavior Analytics (UEBA) assists USCIS Security Operations (SecOps) in identifying behavioral anomalies that most likely indicate malicious intent or heightened risk associated with user identities and endpoint hosts accessing the USCIS network. The analytics provide risk scoring, which helps USCIS SecOps to prioritize highest risk incidents first. The tool identifies credential compromise, risky behavior, violations of the rules of behavior, and other user behavior anomalies that could indicate the presence of an advanced persistent threat. UBEA is enhanced by machine learning models that can adapt to its environment and identify relevant threats, thereby improving the productivity of the USCIS Security Operations Center (SOC). 

UEBA reviews USCIS system logs to determine when an entity, such as a workstation, server, or internal USCIS system account, is performing actions that are anomalous.  The UEBA ingests logs from systems to perform analytics based on manually created and maintained models. These models  apply a risk score to the entity, which is then used to create a case (or ticket) for SecOps analyst to review. The AI reviews the actions of the analysts to adjust the risk scoring for future events, assisting in prioritizing cyber events for further manual investigation.
