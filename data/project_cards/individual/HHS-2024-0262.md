# Machine learning system to predict translational progress in biomedical research
## HHS-2024-0262
_Department of Health and Human Services_ (HHS) / NIH


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Health & Medical
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: A machine learning system that detects whether a research paper is likely to be cited by a future clinical trial or guideline. Translational progress in biomedicine can therefore be assessed and predicted in real time based on information conveyed by the scientific community’s early reaction to a paper. For more information see the publication describing this system: Hutchins et al 2019 (https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000416)

Retired use case
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: A machine learning system that detects whether a research paper is likely to be cited by a future clinical trial or guideline.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Retired
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case was retired or began the process of retirement**: 9/1/2023
