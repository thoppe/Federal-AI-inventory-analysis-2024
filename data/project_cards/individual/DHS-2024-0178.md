## DHS-2024-0178
+ **Title of the AI use case:**: ELIS Card Photo Validation via myUSCIS
+ **Agency responsible for the AI use case:**: Department of Homeland Security
+ **Agency abbreviation:**: DHS
+ **Specific organization(s) within the agency responsible for the AI use case:**: USCIS
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: Government Services (includes Benefits and Service Delivery)
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: 
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B:**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public:**: USCIS uses a system called ELIS to manage immigration requests, and it includes a Photo Validation Service to check if ID photos meet requirements. This helps ensure photos are correct before making ID cards, saving time and avoiding delays.

The photo validation service uses a combination of computer vision techniques and machine learning models to validate photographs and ensure they meet the requirements, so these photos can be used in card production.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc:**: Response back to user based on the pre-defined quality checks if the uploaded photo meets USCIS requirements. Users still have the option to ignore the warnings and upload the photo.
USCIS uses a system called ELIS to manage immigration requests, and it includes a Photo Validation Service to check if ID photos meet requirements. This helps ensure photos are correct before making ID cards, saving time and avoiding delays. USCIS is the component within DHS that oversees lawful immigration to the United States. USCIS receives immigration requests from individuals seeking immigration and non-immigration benefits. Once a benefit request form is submitted to USCIS, a series of processing and adjudication actions occur. One of the case management systems used to track and adjudicate certain immigration request forms is the Electronic Information System (ELIS). USCIS ELIS is an internal case management system composed of microservices to assist with performing complex adjudicative and processing tasks; one of those microservices is the Photo Validation Service. The card photo validation solution was originally designed for e-filed I-765 (c)(3)s — to be in direct support of the beneficiary as they apply via myUSCIS. In enabling e-filing for the (c)(3)s, one goal was to have everything captured digitally, including these ID photos, all while avoiding any new delays or complications for the applicant in the process. In other words, if we observed an issue with a photo upon upload, we wanted to address it up front — rather than waiting until a failed card production sequence.  Because the photo requirements themselves are fixed, this exact same functionality could also be plugged directly into ELIS, just prior to card production. As of late October 2021, an effort to do exactly this is underway. The primary difference is that an adjudicator would explicitly request that a case’s photo be validated, and if applicable, the service would return a recommendation to edit the photo before submission. 

The photo validation service uses a combination of computer vision techniques and machine learning models to validate photographs and ensure they meet the requirements, so these photographs can be used in card production. The output is Response back to user based on the pre-defined quality checks if the uploaded photo meets USCIS requirements. Users still have the option to ignore the warnings and upload the photo.
