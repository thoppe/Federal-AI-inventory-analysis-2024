+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Improving the quality of written communications using AI tools.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: USAGM is exploring the potential of Microsoft Copilot to enhance workplace productivity and collaboration across its internal teams. The tool leverages generative AI capabilities integrated within the Microsoft 365 suite, enabling employees to streamline workflows and focus on high-value tasks. Key features include drafting documents and presentations, summarizing content, automating reminders, managing editorial calendars, scheduling meetings, recording and transcribing conversations, and conducting natural language search for quick access to files and records. This initiative supports operational efficiency by integrating AI capabilities across collaboration, task management, and content creation workflows.

If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
