+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Science & Space
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: WHO’s Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) was developed to support global surveillance and research in order to strengthen the evidence base on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and help inform decision-making and drive national, regional, and global actions. USAID's Infectious Disease Detection and Surveillance (IDDS) project assisted Ministries of Health in Kenya, Cameroon and Liberia to use GLASS. This support included training for surveillance sites to enhance AMR data collection, analysis, interpretation, and reporting to GLASS. This also included regular supportive supervision.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Reports, visualizations
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Retired
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case was retired or began the process of retirement**: 5/1/2024
