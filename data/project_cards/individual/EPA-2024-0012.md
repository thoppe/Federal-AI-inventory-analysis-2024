## EPA-2024-0012
_[Environmental Protection Agency](<../3_agency/Environmental Protection Agency.md>)_ (EPA) / Office of Land and Emergency Management


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Energy & the Environment
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Searching for information using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The intended purpose of this AI use case is to modernize and enhance the EPA's Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS) document search and processing system through intelligent automation. Key expected benefits include:

1. Dramatic improvement in operational efficiency by reducing search time from months/weeks to minutes
2. Enhanced accuracy in document retrieval and information extraction
3. Better user experience through intuitive natural language search capabilities
4. Cost reduction through automated document processing
5. Improved compliance and quality control in environmental site management
6. Increased ability to process and derive insights from millions of technical documents
7. Better decision support for EPA staff managing contaminated sites
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The AI system will generate the following outputs:

1. Intelligent Document Processing Results:
   - Extracted key entities (site locations, contaminants, responsible parties)
   - Document classifications and metadata
   - Automated summaries of technical reports

2. Search and Retrieval Outputs:
   - Relevant document recommendations based on natural language queries
   - Direct answers to specific questions with source citations
   - Cross-document insights and connections

3. Analysis and Decision Support:
   - Site contamination pattern analysis
   - Related case recommendations
   - Risk assessment summaries

4. Quality Assurance Outputs:
   - Confidence scores for extracted information
   - Source attribution for all provided information
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 4/1/2024
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 4/1/2024
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: No
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: No data is used for AI training, finetuning. Subset of agency records is used for evaluation.
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation has been partially completed: Some documentation exists (detailing the composition and any statistical bias or measurement skew for training and evaluation purposes), but documentation took place within this use case’s development.
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: Superfund Enterprise Management System
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: 6-12 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: No
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: Use of existing data platforms: This use case is being developed on existing enterprise data and analytics platforms within the agency rather than procuring additional platforms or SaaS to operate.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Limited documentation for review: Some information regarding the model’s performance on specific benchmarks are available or have been shared with specific stakeholders within the agency.
