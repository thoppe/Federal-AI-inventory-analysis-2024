+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Health & Medical
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Searching for information using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Ordr SCE Analytics employs advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) technologies to further assist in the classification of local networked devices required for accurate device inventory. AI/ML enhances and accelerates the classification process by identifying specific behavior patterns that are unique to certain devices. These passive classification techniques are minimally invasive and do not rely on active scanning methods which are often disruptive to sensitive business-critical IoT devices.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Only network device metadata is forwarded to the SCE Analytics server. Sensitive data such as PHI is immediately discarded so that only metadata which contains information pertinent to device identification is forwarded.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Operation and Maintenance
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 11/2/2021
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 3/7/2022
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 6/27/2024
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: ORDR
