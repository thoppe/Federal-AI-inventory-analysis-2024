+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Health & Medical
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Searching for information using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: We're looking to explore the use of AI to give VA customer service agents better situational awareness to a Veteran through the use of AI tools to summarize and contextualize queries received through our contact centers.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: We'd like to train custom co-pilots on data used by the contact center CRMs, to be able to proactively pull up information relevant to the conversation and the Veteran's queries.  The output would be a window that would display information relevant to the Veterans needs at that time based on the contact center they are working with.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 9/23/2024
