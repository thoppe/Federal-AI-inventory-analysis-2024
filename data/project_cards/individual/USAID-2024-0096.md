+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Use AI/ML algorithms to perform automated "first-pass" reviews and trends analysis of partner-submitted RFSA applications for reduction of burden on BHA staff.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: (1) M&E Plan Review Support: flag missing components of the M&E Plan Narrative (e.g. section headers, required detail, etc.) and create summaries of the M&E Plan Narrative sections.
(2) RFSA Application Review Support:  flag missing components, providing initial scoring of requirements compliance, identifying issues for inclusion in issues letters, summarizing application sections for reviewers, utilizing predictive analytics for objective feasibility and impact assessments, and incorporating data visualization tools to facilitate transparent decision-making.
(3) RFSA Solicitation Issues Letters Analysis: use data from Issues Letters and other data sources to identify trends and issues in the solicitation and application review process for past and future Resilience and Food Security Activities (RFSAs).
