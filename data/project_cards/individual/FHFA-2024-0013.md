+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling

+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Predictive analytics, automated indexing, and anomaly detection in data management and queries.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: SQL Server incorporates AI for predictive analytics, automated indexing, and anomaly detection in data management and queries.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Implementation and Assessment
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
