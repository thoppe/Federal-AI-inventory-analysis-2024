## DHS-2024-0134
_[Department of Homeland Security](<../3_agency/Department of Homeland Security.md>)_ (DHS) / TSA


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Transportation
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The purpose of this use case is to improve upon Automated Target Recognition (ATR) algorithms used to reduce privacy concerns because a TSO is no longer required to view Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) images. The expected benefits are to increase detection, reduce false alarms, and improve efficiency and passenger experience.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The system reproduces the threat location, which is viewed as a bounding box on a representative human figure, for TSO resolution.
Automated Target Recognition (ATR) uses AI and machine learning to conduct real-time object recognition and anomaly, or target, detection on the Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) machines to automatically detect possible prohibited items carried by passengers on their person through checkpoint. The system then reproduces the threat location on a representative human figure using a coordinate transform function (CTF) for resolution by Transportation Security Officers (TSOs). By using trained AI algorithms, TSA may display a potential threat location on a representative human figure to show TSOs visual outlines of suspected threat or prohibited items. The purpose of this use case is to improve upon ATR algorithms used to reduce privacy concerns because after this enhancement TSOs are no longer required to view AIT images. Operational systems do not continue to collect images or train the algorithm. The expected benefits are to increase detection, reduce false alarms, and improve efficiency and passenger experience. 

The system reproduces the threat location, which is viewed as a bounding box on a representative human figure, for TSO resolution. 
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Both
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 6/22/2017
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 6/22/2017
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with contracting resources.
+ **Identification of the Procurement Instrument Identifier(s) (PIID) of the contract(s) used for the AI use case**: 70T04023C7573N001
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: Yes
+ **Identification of the High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) that the AI use case supports**: Transportation Security Administration – DHS
+ **Identification of the specific public-facing service that the AI use case supports**: Completing TSA passenger screening
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: No
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: TSA owns AIT image scans which are used for algorithm development. The scans contain threat images and are potentially sensitive.
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation has been partially completed: Some documentation exists (detailing the composition and any statistical bias or measurement skew for training and evaluation purposes), but documentation took place within this use case’s development.
+ **Identification of the demographic features explicitly utilized in the AI use case’s data/model(s), if any**: None
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: No
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: More than 12 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: No
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: No
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Other
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: Use of existing data platforms: This use case is being developed on existing enterprise data and analytics platforms within the agency rather than procuring additional platforms or SaaS to operate.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: No documentation is available: No documentation detailing model performance metrics, model architecture, features and intended use of the models have been created or are currently accessible to other data science teams within the agency.
