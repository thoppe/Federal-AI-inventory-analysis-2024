+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: Creating visual representations of data sets for reports and presentations using AI.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Increased Productivity: By automating routine tasks, both coders and designers can work faster and more efficiently.
Improved Quality: AI can enhance the quality of code and designs through intelligent analysis and suggestions.
Accessibility: It can make coding and design more accessible to non-experts, democratizing creative processes.
Innovation: By offering new perspectives and solutions, AI can drive innovation in both fields.
Overall, the integration of AI into coding and creative design aims to enhance human capabilities, foster creativity, and improve overall outcomes in both areas.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Code Snippets: Automatically generated blocks of code based on user prompts or requirements. Bug Reports: Detailed analyses of code with identified issues and suggestions for fixes. Documentation: Automatically generated documentation for codebases, explaining functions, classes, and usage. Refactored Code: Improved versions of existing code that enhance readability, efficiency, or performance. Test Cases: Suggested test cases or automated tests generated to ensure code functionality and reliability.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 8/1/2024
