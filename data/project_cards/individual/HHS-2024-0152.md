# CLAT (Computerized Labeling Assessment Tool)
## HHS-2024-0152
_[Department of Health and Human Services](<../3_agency/Department of Health and Human Services.md>)_ (HHS) / FDA


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: CLAT uses computer programming, image processing, and AI to assist the human review of drug labeling, including container labels, carton labeling, prescribing information, and Instructions for Use. CLAT assists the human visual comparison of drug labeling against a library of FDA regulations, guidances, standards, and best practices. CLAT identifies potential labeling deviations for human evaluation. 

CLAT is used to improve efficiencies in the manual labeling review process to help the reviewer mitigate medication errors and standardize labeling across therapeutic drug classes and product types. CLAT also assists the reviewer to catch deviations between label versions so no unintended errors have been introduced.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The tool processes images of carton and container labeling to identify minimum requirements on a label, identify availability of objects on an image, color differentiation of strength, missing barcode and orientation, incorrect or missing strength statement, error prone abbreviation, look-alike labels and text prominence. This will assist the reviewer by  improving the efficiency of drug labeling reviews, including container labels, carton labeling, prescribing information, and Instructions for Use.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 9/1/2020
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 9/1/2020
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with contracting resources.
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Yes
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: Label and Container cartons
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is complete
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: CDEROne Analytics: FISMA-high environment
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: 6-12 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: None: This use case does not re-use any internally developed tooling or managed infrastructure from any other AI development efforts within the agency.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: No documentation is available: No documentation detailing model performance metrics, model architecture, features and intended use of the models have been created or are currently accessible to other data science teams within the agency.
