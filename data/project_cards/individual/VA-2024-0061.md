+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Other
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Research
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: This risk model is being used within the framework of a nationwide, VA funded randomized controlled trial to deliver a precision prostate cancer screening intervention to research participants. The model uses machine learning components (e.g., training and validation sets from MVP and other external sources, LASSO-regularized Cox model) and genetic, ancestry, and self-report family history of prostate cancer data to develop and validate a risk prediction model to help stratify new participants into three distinct prostate cancer risk categories (low risk, average risk, high risk). The risk classification is then included as part of a comprehensive report, including a full risk model report from a VA-approved genetic testing laboratory, a monogenic genetic variant report from a VA-approved genetic testing laboratory, and a summary sheet which provide general information and risk-specific recommendations surrounding prostate cancer screening. The report is shared with the participant and their VA healthcare providers as additional information to be used within the  framework of shared decision-making regarding future prostate cancer screening.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The risk model uses new participant data to output a risk classification for prostate cancer based on genetic, ancestry, and self-report family history of prostate cancer data (low risk, average risk, high risk). The classification is is then included as part of a comprehensive report that is delivered to the participant and their VA healthcare providers to be used within the framework of shared decision-making regarding future prostate cancer screening.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Both
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 8/1/2023
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 3/1/2024
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with both contracting and in-house resources.
+ **Identification of the Procurement Instrument Identifier(s) (PIID) of the contract(s) used for the AI use case**: 36C24124D0061, 36C24124C0018
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency’s Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP) has assessed the privacy risks associated with this AI use case**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: Other
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the rights datasets to begin model development**: Model was developed and validated by VA researchers using Million Veteran Program (MVP) data available only to approved researchers. Model translation to a genetic test and intervention materials are being developed by a VA-approved genetic testing laboratory.
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: Million Veteran Program (MVP) data
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is complete: Documentation exists regarding the maintenance, composition, quality, and intended use of the training and evaluation data, as well as any statistical bias across model features and protected groups.
+ **Identification of the demographic features explicitly utilized in the AI use case’s data/model(s), if any**: ["Race/Ethnicity"]
+ **Identification of the other demographic features explicitly utilized in the AI use case’s data/model(s), if any**: Model is specific to prostate cancer, so is only applicable to persons of male sex (not a specific variable in the model). Race/ethnicity data is genetically inferred ancestry.
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: Yes – agency has access to source code, but it is not public.
+ **Link to publicly available source code for the AI use case, if available, in alignment with OMB Memorandum M-24-10’s section on sharing**: Code is not publicly available, but is stored within VA systems (Genisis).
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: No
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: Less than 6 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: No
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: Use of existing data platforms: This use case is being developed on existing enterprise data and analytics platforms within the agency rather than procuring additional platforms or SaaS to operate.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Documentation has been developed: Complete documentation detailing model performance across a range of benchmarks, architecture, relevant features and information regarding the appropriate use of the model for predictive tasks has been created.
