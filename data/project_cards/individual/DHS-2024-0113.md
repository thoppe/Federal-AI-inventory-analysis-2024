+ **Title of the AI use case:**: Translation and Transcription for Investigative Data
+ **Agency responsible for the AI use case:**: Department of Homeland Security
+ **Agency abbreviation:**: DHS
+ **Specific organization(s) within the agency responsible for the AI use case:**: ICE
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: Law & Justice
+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case:**: 
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B:**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public:**: HSI investigators often encounter data from various sources, including legal and administrative processes, enforcement actions, and open-source materials, in languages other than English. To unlock the value of this data, it must be translated into English before further analysis can be conducted. The Translation and Transcription Service leverages neural machine translation (NMT) models for text translation and automatic speech recognition (ASR) and deep neural network (DNN) models with normalization for voice-to-text transcription. This innovative approach enables users to quickly triage large datasets and identify key information relevant to investigations. Any data deemed critical for court proceedings is then submitted to certified human translators for final review, ensuring that government resources are allocated efficiently and only used for necessary translations and transcriptions.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc:**: The Translation and Transcription Service leverages neural machine translation (NMT) models for text translation and automatic speech recognition (ASR) and deep neural network (DNN) models with normalization for voice-to-text transcription.
Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is a critical component of ICE, responsible for investigating a wide range of crimes that threaten national security, public safety, and the economy. With a mission to protect the United States from transnational crime and terrorism, HSI works to disrupt and dismantle complex organizations that engage in human trafficking, narcotics smuggling, cybercrime, and other illicit activities. To achieve this mission, HSI relies on advanced technologies and innovative solutions to analyze and process vast amounts of data, including audio and video evidence. HSI investigators often encounter data from various sources, including legal and administrative processes, enforcement actions, and open-source materials, in languages other than English. To unlock the value of this data, it must be translated into English before further analysis can be conducted. The Translation and Transcription Service leverages neural machine translation (NMT) models for text translation and automatic speech recognition (ASR) and deep neural network (DNN) models with normalization for voice-to-text transcription. This innovative approach enables users to quickly triage large datasets and identify key information relevant to investigations. Any data deemed critical for court proceedings is then submitted to certified human translators for final review, ensuring that government resources are allocated efficiently and only used for necessary translations and transcriptions. HSI uses this tool to generate leads, and further action is required by investigators and analysts as part of the full investigative process before any action is taken against an individual.
