# Autocoding to Support Adverse Drug Event Surveillance
## HHS-2024-0058
_Department of Health and Human Services_ (HHS) / CDC


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The model will help surveillance epidemiologists working at CDC to determine whether reported potential adverse drug events in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System Cooperative Adverse Drug event Surveillance meet the agency's surveillance case definition for the same.

It will speed up coding of the drug event reports, helping epidemiologists produce prevalence estimates for the surveillance system.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: The model will take a de-identified free-text description of the patient's emergency department visit encounter, along with a handful of other pre-coded variables, and output the probability that the encounter meets the case definition.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 5/1/2024
