# Knowledge Navigator
## HHS-2024-0176
_Department of Health and Human Services_ (HHS) / HRSA


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Government Services (includes Benefits and Service Delivery)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: The objective is to develop an AI model that can answer detailed and complex questions about the key programmatic document, Application and Program Guidance (APG), that is issued annually before the application cycle opens. The PoC LLM has Applicant and Program Guidance (APG) documents for 10 loan repayments and scholarship programs.

This will allow loan repayment and scholarship analysts and call center agents to  better respond to public inquiries from applicants and participants.  If successful the Knowledge Navigator could be made available to applicants and participants and reduce the volume of calls to the BHW Call Center along with the number of call center agents.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: BHW has implemented a proof of concept Generative AI (GenAI) Large Language Model (LLM) Knowledge Navigator (KN) to support National Health Service Corps (NHSC) and Nurse Corps loan repayment and scholarship program analysts and call center agents respond to program applicants and participants.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Acquisition and/or Development
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 2/1/2024
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 2/1/2024
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with both contracting and in-house resources.
+ **Identification of the Procurement Instrument Identifier(s) (PIID) of the contract(s) used for the AI use case**: 75R60224F34005
+ **Whether the AI use case made use of agency-wide infrastructure to quickly identify the right datasets to begin model development**: No
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: HRSA Application and Program Guidance (APG) documents for 10 HRSA loan repayment and scholarship programs.  All of which are public documents.  Here is an example: https://nhsc.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/nhsc/loan-repayment/nhsc-students2service-lrp-application-program-guidance.pdf
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is widely available
+ **Whether the AI use case itself has an associated Authority to Operate (ATO), or is part of a system that has an ATO**: Yes
+ **Name of the system(s) associated with this AI use case, according to the ATO**: Bureau of Health Workforce Management Information System Solution (BMISS) Platform (UII: 009-000004158
+ **Estimated length of time the AI project waited for basic computing and developer tools to build machine learning models. This includes Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), along with access to open-source code libraries, frameworks, and other coding software or developer environments**: Less than 6 months
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: No
+ **Explanation for whether the AI use case has an identifiable process to request computing resources (such as cloud computing credits or computing hardware) to develop and test models**: Yes
+ **Has the communication been timely**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: None: This use case does not re-use any internally developed tooling or managed infrastructure from any other AI development efforts within the agency.
+ **Whether information regarding the AI use case has been made widely accessible within the agency**: Limited documentation for review: Some information regarding the model’s performance on specific benchmarks are available or have been shared with specific stakeholders within the agency.
