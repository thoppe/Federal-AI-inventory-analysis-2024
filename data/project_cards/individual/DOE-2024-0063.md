+ **Whether the AI use case disseminates information to the public**: Yes
+ **Description of how the agency is ensuring that this AI use case is compliant with Information Quality Act guidelines and OMB Memorandum M-19-15, if applicable**: "To demonstrate compliance with the DOE Information Quality Act (IQA) guidelines, the approach with RAG and LLM-based applications ensures the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of disseminated information. 

Quality and Objectivity: The approach uses a locked-down Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that minimizes inaccuracies (hallucinations) and excludes memory components, ensuring accurate, clear, and reliable information presentation. This satisfies the IQA's requirement for objective, unbiased dissemination and maintains transparency.

Utility: Integrating metadata-driven semantic search in the vector database enhances the utility of DOE's data catalog for public users, meeting the IQA's standard for usefulness. This utility-focused design ensures that data is accessible, relevant, and usable for public insights, supporting transparency and public knowledge.

Transparency and Reproducibility: The approach supports data reproducibility by basing responses on catalog metadata and summary information, ensuring consistency and enabling independent reanalysis by qualified users. Transparency is further upheld through documentation of the RAG interactions, aligning with the IQA's standards for open access and transparency in information dissemination.

Response to Public Needs: This design incorporates continuous feedback to improve relevance and usability, engaging public and stakeholder needs effectively. It aligns with the IQA's goal of considering public feedback in information quality and ensuring accountability through documented, high-level review processes for data corrections if requested.

By adhering to these DOE IQA guidelines, this approach ensures public trust in DOE's open data, demonstrating alignment with the standards of quality, utility, objectivity, and integrity as required under OMB M-19-15."

This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: As this is summarizing data from the GDR data repository the related datasets are described by the catalog which is also used to validate the AI responses:  https://gdr.openei.org/
+ **Whether the data has sufficient documentation of its integrity, quality, and validity as a training set for a specific task**: Documentation is widely available: Documentation is not only complete, but is widely accessible within the agency, and has an owner and a regular update cadence.
+ **Whether this AI project includes custom-developed code**: Yes
+ **Whether the agency has access to the code associated with the AI use case**: Yes – agency has access to source code, but it is not public.

+ **Whether the agency requested an extension for this AI use case, in response to the CAIO’s request, of up to one year for the minimum requirements outlined in Section 5 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: No – Agency did not request an extension for this use case.
+ **Whether an AI impact assessment for the AI use case has been completed, consistent with Section 5(c)(iv)(A) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. This assessment should document at least the intended purpose for the AI and its expected benefits, the potential risks of using the AI, and the quality and appropriateness of the relevant data**: Planned or in-progress.

This can be informed by publicly known risks identified in similar use cases or contexts. Examples of such risks include at least physical injury, emotional/psychological injury, opportunity loss, economic loss, privacy loss, environmental impact, or civil rights and civil liberties impact**: As the use case for the AI has been limited to summarization of existing metadata the key risks were identified as LLM hallucinations or LLM generated text which would cause reputational harm to DOE.   Techniques such as red-teaming, adversarial testing, and prompt-injection testing were used to evaluate constraint of hallucinations and LLM.
+ **Whether an independent evaluation of the AI use case has been conducted through the CAIO, an agency AI oversight board, or other appropriate agency office with existing test and evaluation responsibilities, consistent with Section 5(c)(iv)(C) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. The independent reviewing authority must not have been directly involved in the AI system’s development**: Planned or in-progress
+ **Whether there’s an established process for monitoring performance of the AI system’s functionality and changes to its impact on rights and/or safety, including, if relevant, the risk of AI-enabled discrimination, consistent with Section 5(c)(iv)(D) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Intermittent and Manually Updated: A plan for monitoring the AI use case is in place, and requires data science teams to work with DevOps engineers to manually update models at scheduled intervals, and create metrics to detect data distribution shifts between the operational environment and the training data for the model.
+ **Whether the agency has determined that the AI can carry out its individual core decisions or actions that could result in a significant impact on rights and safety without direct human involvement. The answer should not be “yes” if humans are not reviewing individual decisions and are only overseeing or reviewing the performance of the system in general**: No - Some individual decisions or actions require direct human oversight.
+ **How the agency is providing reasonable and timely notice regarding the use of AI, consistent with Section 5(c)(iv)(I) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Online – in the terms or instruction for the service

There are built-in guardrails in place to prevent abuse
+ **Whether the agency has established a fallback and escalation process, which may include reverting to manual human processes, in the event that an impacted individual would like to appeal or contest an AI system’s outcome, consistent with Section 5(c)(v)(E) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: No – it is not operationally practical to offer this.
+ **Why the agency does not have an established fallback and escalation process**: As the action of the system is to summarize and communicate existing information returned for a query, the ability of the AI to make impact individuals or groups is significantly limited.
