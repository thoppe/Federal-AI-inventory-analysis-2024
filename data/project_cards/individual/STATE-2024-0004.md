_[Department of State](<../3_agency/Department of State.md>)_ (STATE) / A/PRI/LS


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabeling
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: Leveraging machine-based tools to streamline workflows in translation work. Machine output is carefully post-edited by professional human translators to ensure highest quality product.
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Very rough suggested language that is carefully reviewed and edited by human professional translators.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Implementation and Assessment
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 1/19/2024
+ **Date when the acquisition and/or development of the AI system associated with the use case first began**: 1/19/2024
+ **Date when the AI use case was fully implemented and deployed into use**: 1/19/2024
+ **Whether the AI system involved in the use case was developed, or is expected to be developed, exclusively with contracting resources, in-house, or a combination of both**: Developed with both contracting and in-house resources.
+ **Whether the AI use case supports a High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) public-facing service. The full list of HISP public-facing services can be found at https://www.performance.gov/cx/hisps/**: No
+ **Identification of the High-Impact Service Provider (HISP) that the AI use case supports**: No
+ **Whether the AI use case involves personally identifiable information (PII), as defined in OMB Circular A-130**: No
+ **General description of the data used for training, fine-tuning, and evaluation of the AI use case’s model(s). This should include a description of any data provided by the agency, whether the datasets are research datasets, publicly available, external, etc. and to the extent possible, sufficiently descriptive information from the vendor**: In-house curated translation memory for training and fine-tuning models
+ **Whether the required IT infrastructure is identified and provisioned via a centralized process (such as a unified intake form) that enables product owners and developers to find the right development environment inside the agency**: Yes
+ **Whether the AI use case promotes re-use of existing infrastructure to promote AI development**: No
