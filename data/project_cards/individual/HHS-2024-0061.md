# Distiller SR: AI to screen research articles for Community Guide reviews
## HHS-2024-0061
_[Department of Health and Human Services](../3_agency/Department of Health and Human Services.md)_ (HHS) / CDC


+ **The topic area that most closely aligns with the AI use case**: Mission-Enabling (internal agency support)
+ **Whether the use case is implemented solely with the commercial-off-the-shelf or freely available AI products identified in Appendix B**: None of the above.
+ **Description of the AI’s intended purpose, including: (1) what problem the AI is used to solve and (2) the expected benefits and positive outcomes from the AI for an agency’s mission and/or the general public**: This tool will be used to screen research articles that will be used to inform Community Preventive Services Task Force recommendations (a body that produces guidelines independent of CDC). 

Use of this technology may increase the speed with which systematic reviews can be conducted. This may expedite the time it takes to evaluate the effectiveness of public health programs for a CPSTF recommendation (not a CDC guideline).
+ **Description of what the AI system outputs, whether it’s a prediction, recommendation, decision, etc**: Machine learning will be used to more efficiently screen research articles relevant to evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention.
+ **The current stage of System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for the AI use case (See System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) - Glossary | NIST CSRC)**: Initiated
+ **Whether the AI use case is rights-impacting or safety-impacting, as defined in Section 6 of OMB Memorandum M-24-10. Note also that Appendix I of that memorandum lists categories of use cases that are presumed by default to impact rights and safety. If your use case falls into those lists, you must not answer “neither” to this question without a formal determination made by your agency’s Chief AI Officer, pursuant to Section 5(b) of OMB Memorandum M-24-10**: Neither
+ **Date when the AI use case’s purpose and high-level requirements were first defined**: 5/1/2023
