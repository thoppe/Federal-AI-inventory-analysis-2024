Individual Assistance (IA) & Public Assistance (PA) Projections,Department of Homeland Security,DHS,FEMA,Government Services (includes Benefits and Service Delivery),,None of the above.,"The purpose of these supervised learning models is two-fold:

1.	For informational purposes: the models will produce predictions for to-be-determined quantities of interest. These quantities are often of interest to Agency personnel in the field, region, and headquarters, as well as DHS, OMB, NSC, and the Whitehouse.
2.	For decisional purposes: in addition to being informative, the model’s predictions are likely to be used for decision making. This may include implicit use (e.g., seeing that there are a large number of households that require assistance may motivate FEMA CFO to consider requesting additional funding for the Disaster Relief Fund) or explicit use (e.g., the number of estimated housing units required may be used to determine the number of housing units to order just-in-time).

Anticipated benefits of using supervised learning models include:
1.	Increased predictive performance: supervised learning models offer means of quantifying and choosing models with the best possible predictive performance.
2.	Timely prediction: supervised learning models can produce reasonably high performance predictions based on limited data.
3.	Quantification of uncertainty: supervised learning models are able to provide prediction intervals and predictive distributions in addition to point predictions to give users a sense of how uncertainty is inherent in the prediction.

The campaign includes guidance and resources to help passengers prepare for the security screening process in the COVID environment. A big part of that campaign was the development of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Airport Hotspot Throughput. This capability determines the domestic airports that have the highest rank of connecting flights during the holiday travel season to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This capability is a DHS-developed artificial intelligence model written in Spark/Scala that takes historical non-PII travel data and computes the highest-ranking airports based on the PageRank algorithm. TSA does not make decisions about flight cancellations or airport closures. These decisions are made locally, on a case-by-case basis, by individual airlines, airports, and public health officials. TSA will continuously evaluate and adapt procedures and policies to keep the public and our workforce safe as we learn more about this devastating disease and how it spreads.","This use case is inactive.

I-485 Family Matching,Department of Homeland Security,DHS,USCIS,,,None of the above.,"I-485 Family Matching is designed to create models to match family members to underlying I-485 petitions. The underlying immigrant petition defines if the I-485 is employment-based or family-based. It also has information about the visa classification and priority date which, when compared against the Department of State’s monthly Visa Bulletin, helps predict visa usage. It is difficult to match an I-485 to its underlying immigrant petition, because the only available field on which to match is the Alien-number (A-number). This number is not always present on the immigrant petition, and name/date of birth matching is not as reliable.  The goal of I-485 Family Matching is to leverage AI to create connections more confidently between petitioners and their families based on limited data.  Additionally, it was intended to help identify and group I485s filed by family members, as well as gather up the many ancillary forms they may have been pending (such as I765, I131). Similar to immigrant petition matching, it can be difficult to match up I485s filed by family members. In these cases, the only similar fields are a common address. Efforts have been made in the past to identify family members by address, but it is effective only to a point. This use case explored the technical feasibility of using an AI model to help make working with this data more reliable (as well as group individual petitioners, their families, and other helpful associated data together for faster and more accurate processing).  Work on this use case did not go beyond ideation and no AI model was built (and no output was rendered) after the proof-of-concept established that the desired end-state was infeasible with the technology available at that time.","This use case is inactive.

Real Time Classification for the Economic Census,Department of Commerce,DOC,CENSUS - U.S. Census Bureau,Other,Classification,None of the above.,"Two ML models (BEACON and SINCT) are applied in this Economic Census use case to perform real-time classification of Primary Business Activity (PBA), or NAICS, and Products, or NAPCS. For instance, in the 2017 Economic Census, if respondents could not identify their NAICS or NAPCS codes, they were able to provide a short, open-ended description of their business and the products and services they offer, referred to as “write-ins”. There were nearly 400,000 NAICS write-ins and 1,000,000 NAPCS write-ins, out of 3 million and 18 million total reported NAICS and NAPCS codes, respectively. While the number of write-ins is a small share of the total number of reported NAICS and NAPCS codes, these write-ins were previously assigned to a valid code by analysts using manual processes. BEACON and SINCT were developed to improve classification accuracy and reduce processing time and costs by providing real-time feedback to respondents given the business description they provide. In the 2022 Economic Census, as a result of BEACON and SINCT, NAICS and NAPCS write-ins were reduced by 58% and 78% to 168,000 and 220,000 write-ins, respectively.","For PBA code reporting, the respondent has an initial set of NAICS codes to choose from.  If the respondent selects ""Other"" with a write-in, an API call to BEACON returns predictive results from the model with a ranked list of predicted NAICS options from which to select.  For Products, if the respondent selects to ""Add products"", an API call to SINCT provides predictive results of products to add. In both cases, the ML model recommends codes based on scoring attributes, and the respondent is able to choose a relevant NAICS or NAPCS code from those results.",Retired,Neither,,,1/1/2023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 2025 Census Test is a proposed test as part of the Small-Scale Response Test (SmaRT) program in decennial. The purpose of this program is to perform experiments using different methods to improve self-response rates and data collection. The SmaRT program accomplishes this using iterative tests with relatively small sample sizes. Four installments of the SmaRT program were fielded before the 2020 Census. Three small-scale tests have occurred so far this decade with the fourth test planned for 2025. There is an online questionnaire for each of the tests, with a census.gov landing page to access the online questionnaire. In the first three tests this decade, there were approximately 15 FAQs on the landing page that the user could read. For the 2025 Census Test, we would like to offer over 50 FAQs to answer the public’s questions via a search tool.
Current public-facing search tools at the Census Bureau use exact match only. Depending on what users type to search, the correct FAQ might not appear because users do not always use the same terminology as the Census Bureau. This FAQ search tool built with machine-learning models will use semantic similarity (i.e., synonyms or misspellings) to find the correct answers. The answers it provides back to the public are census-approved answers, and not generative AI answers. If the 2025 Census Test is approved, this search feature will be on the landing page for the survey. Implementing this search tool is considered a proof-of-concept for the use of such a search feature. If it is successful, the search tool could be used in the 2026 Census Test on its landing page, or the 2028 Dress Rehearsal.

They documented that the most significant risk to NIST is moderate-level data going to a cloud vendor that does not have a FedRAMP authorized package and is not currently in process to become FedRAMP. Grammarly does not meet Department of Commerce Security and Privacy Assessment and Authorization Handbook requirements. There are deficiencies restricting staff to US only personnel, specific documentation about use of FIPS 140-2 validated encryption, TIC 2.0 architecture implementation, and Grammarly is unable to send logs to DOC SIEM tools.

This is mitigated in multiple ways:
•	Grammarly has multiple independent assessments, including a SOC 2 Type II assessment.
•	Grammarly provided other internal security documentation for review.
•	NIST data is only used by Grammarly to perform grammar recommendations. All data is purged from Grammarly servers within 3 hours.
•	NIST data is not used for training purposes.
•	Grammarly uses Amazon Web services for its infrastructure, which has FedRAMP Moderate authorization.
•	Grammarly uses Microsoft Azure AI for AI recommendations, which has FedRAMP High authorization.

Other key risks are as follows: 

•	Logins to Grammarly are logged and viewable by administrators, but the actual usage of Grammarly by the user is not logged. This is mitigated by Grammarly’s limited built-in data loss prevention (DLP) that is enabled. This prevents the following data types from going up to Grammarly for analysis: email addresses, URLs, phone numbers, credit card numbers, and Social Security numbers.

Quality and Objectivity: The approach uses a locked-down Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that minimizes inaccuracies (hallucinations) and excludes memory components, ensuring accurate, clear, and reliable information presentation. This satisfies the IQA's requirement for objective, unbiased dissemination and maintains transparency.

Utility: Integrating metadata-driven semantic search in the vector database enhances the utility of DOE's data catalog for public users, meeting the IQA's standard for usefulness. This utility-focused design ensures that data is accessible, relevant, and usable for public insights, supporting transparency and public knowledge.

Transparency and Reproducibility: The approach supports data reproducibility by basing responses on catalog metadata and summary information, ensuring consistency and enabling independent reanalysis by qualified users. Transparency is further upheld through documentation of the RAG interactions, aligning with the IQA's standards for open access and transparency in information dissemination.

Response to Public Needs: This design incorporates continuous feedback to improve relevance and usability, engaging public and stakeholder needs effectively. It aligns with the IQA's goal of considering public feedback in information quality and ensuring accountability through documented, high-level review processes for data corrections if requested.

Quality and Objectivity: The approach uses a locked-down Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that minimizes inaccuracies (hallucinations) and excludes memory components, ensuring accurate, clear, and reliable information presentation. This satisfies the IQA's requirement for objective, unbiased dissemination and maintains transparency.

Utility: Integrating metadata-driven semantic search in the vector database enhances the utility of DOE's data catalog for public users, meeting the IQA's standard for usefulness. This utility-focused design ensures that data is accessible, relevant, and usable for public insights, supporting transparency and public knowledge.

Transparency and Reproducibility: The approach supports data reproducibility by basing responses on catalog metadata and summary information, ensuring consistency and enabling independent reanalysis by qualified users. Transparency is further upheld through documentation of the RAG interactions, aligning with the IQA's standards for open access and transparency in information dissemination.

Response to Public Needs: This design incorporates continuous feedback to improve relevance and usability, engaging public and stakeholder needs effectively. It aligns with the IQA's goal of considering public feedback in information quality and ensuring accountability through documented, high-level review processes for data corrections if requested.

",No,,,Yes,"""To demonstrate compliance with the DOE Information Quality Act (IQA) guidelines, the approach with RAG and LLM-based applications ensures the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of disseminated information. 

Quality and Objectivity: The approach uses a locked-down Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that minimizes inaccuracies (hallucinations) and excludes memory components, ensuring accurate, clear, and reliable information presentation. This satisfies the IQA's requirement for objective, unbiased dissemination and maintains transparency.

Utility: Integrating metadata-driven semantic search in the vector database enhances the utility of DOE's data catalog for public users, meeting the IQA's standard for usefulness. This utility-focused design ensures that data is accessible, relevant, and usable for public insights, supporting transparency and public knowledge.

Transparency and Reproducibility: The approach supports data reproducibility by basing responses on catalog metadata and summary information, ensuring consistency and enabling independent reanalysis by qualified users. Transparency is further upheld through documentation of the RAG interactions, aligning with the IQA's standards for open access and transparency in information dissemination.

Response to Public Needs: This design incorporates continuous feedback to improve relevance and usability, engaging public and stakeholder needs effectively. It aligns with the IQA's goal of considering public feedback in information quality and ensuring accountability through documented, high-level review processes for data corrections if requested.

By adhering to these DOE IQA guidelines, this approach ensures public trust in DOE's open data, demonstrating alignment with the standards of quality, utility, objectivity, and integrity as required under OMB M-19-15.""

Description:    We are addressing the challenge of providing quick, accurate, and consistent responses to both internal customer service agents and external customers. Currently, agents must manually search through extensive documentation, which can lead to delays in service response times, inconsistencies in information shared, and a potential for human error. Additionally, external customers often need direct access to information on our website but must wait for human support, which impacts customer satisfaction.
 
By implementing a customized AI chatbot, we aim to streamline access to knowledge for agents, reducing their workload and improving efficiency. Additionally, a customer-facing chatbot would offer external customers instant answers to common questions, further enhancing customer experience and reducing the volume of support inquiries handled by human agents.","Streamline access to knowledge for agents, reducing their workload and improving efficiency.

CESU project to detect of bird nests using deep learning to support annual colonial bird monitoring,Department of the Interior,DOI,NPS,Mission-Enabling (internal agency support),,None of the above.,"This work is already being accomplished via a cooperative agreement with a university (Florida International University)

The National Park Service (NPS), has been monitoring colonial nesting birds monthly via low level aerial photography from a helicopter platform in Biscayne National Park since 2010. These photographs are processed to determine the number of active nests for specific focal species: Double-crested Cormorants, Great Egrets, Great White Herons, Great Blue Herons, White Ibises, and Roseate Spoonbills. NPS now has 13 years of data which is composed of 64,350 uniquely identified nests and 57,793 birds representing.

This monitoring is time consuming and needs to be accomplished consistently and accurately. Currently, the aerial photos are processed by individuals. Which takes substantial time and effort. We propose to explore the creation of automatic script that would allow the active nest to be identified using software. The goal of this project is to explore software programs and create automatic script that can identify potential bird nests on the photograph and to highlight this area on the photograph. By developing a robust object detection model, researchers can monitor bird colonies and their populations more efficiently, e.g. by consistently identifying nests with software which will allow the tracking of nesting patterns with less person effort needed to accomplish this task.

Effects of vehicle traffic on space use and road crossings of caribou in the Arctic,Department of the Interior,DOI,USGS,Mission-Enabling,,None of the above.,"Assessing the effects of industrial development on wildlife is a key objective of managers and conservation practitioners. However, wildlife responses are often only investigated with respect to the footprint of infrastructure, even though human activity can strongly mediate development impacts. In Arctic Alaska, there is substantial interest in expanding energy development, raising concerns about the potential effects on barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti). While caribou generally avoid industrial infrastructure, little is known about the role of human activity in moderating their responses, and whether managing activity levels could minimize development effects. To address this uncertainty, we examined the influence of traffic volume on caribou summer space use and road crossings in the Central Arctic Herd within the Kuparuk and Milne Point oil fields on the North Slope of Alaska.","Prediction of liquefaction potential at input site, as it compares to existing case history dataset.

Downscaling and assimilation of meteorology data for local estimates of irrigation water demand.,Department of the Interior,DOI,USGS,Mission-Enabling,,None of the above.,"   We found that in the context of satellite remote sensing for estimates of crop water use, high-frequency and low resolution gridded meteorological reanalysis data contributes about half the total error in our estimates. This is due to well-documented localized effects of terrain and land use that aren't accounted for in meteorological forcing datasets such as NLDAS-2 or ERA-5. Our work suggests that assimilating local meteorological station data alongside land use and terrain information may improve the accuracy of our estimates of local-scale atmospheric demand (i.e., reference evapotranspiration, a function of temperature, wind speed, humidity, and solar radiation). The relationship between the reanalysis products and observed local meteorology appears complex and non-linear. We've found that using deep learning techniques, including Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) time series modeling along Graph Neural Networks to assimilate local meteorological observations offers promise to improve our local-scale estimates atmospheric demand, and thus irrigated crop water use. We hope to use the information we've gathered to add value to existing meteorological forcing datasets by developing software that reliably downscales low spatial resolution datasets to make more accurate estimates of irrigation water use.

"Quantifying the effects of land-use change and bioenergy crop production on pollinators, wildlife, a",Department of the Interior,DOI,USGS,Mission-Enabling,,None of the above.,"The annual migration of monarch butterflies in North America represents a biological phenomenon unique to our planet,
covering more than 4,000 kilometers and requiring multiple generations of monarchs to complete. The monarch was proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act in 2014 because of significant population declines and extinction risk. Disappearance of milkweed, the essential host plant for monarch larvae, has been implicated in the decline of the eastern monarch population. The objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of using uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS) and artificial neural networks to quantify the density of common and showy milkweed in working grasslands of Minnesota and North Dakota. First, NPWRC scientists will develop a machine learning algorithm for detecting milkweeds from UAS-collected aerial images. Second, NPWRC will validate the algorithm by comparing plot-level counts of milkweed estimated from UAS images to field count data across a range of milkweed densities. Lastly, NPWRC will take steps towards facilitating the integration of this technology into the Integrated Monarch Monitoring Program by estimating the number of spatially independent UAS images required for achieving accurate and precise estimates of milkweed across entire fields.

Machine-learning model to delineate sub-surface agricultural drainage from satellite imagery,Department of the Interior,DOI,USGS,Mission-Enabling,,None of the above.,"We trained a UNet machine-learning model, a convolutional neural network designed to highlight objects of interest within an image, to delineate tile-drain networks in panchromatic satellite imagery without additional data on soils, topography, or historical tile-drain extent. This was done by training the model to match the accuracy of human experts manually tracing the surface representation of tile drains in satellite imagery. Our approach began with a library of images that were used to train and quantify the accuracy of the model, with model performance tested on imagery from two areas that were not used to train the model. Satellite imagery included acquisition dates from 2008 to 2020. Training imagery was from agricultural areas within the US Great Lakes basin. Validation imagery was from the upper Maumee River, tributary to western Lake Erie, and an Indiana, Ohio-River headwater tributary. Our analysis of the satellite imagery paired with meteorological and soil data found that during spring, a combination of relatively high solar radiation, intermediate soil-water content and bare fields enabled the best model performance. Each area of interest was heavily tile-drained, where better understanding the movement of water, nutrients, and sediment from fields to downstream water bodies is key to managing harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. The trained UNet model successfully identified tile drains visible in the validation imagery. https://doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.20493",Outputs were not documented and DOI will update the use cases once additional data is collected from submitter,Implementation and Assessment,Neither,,,,,Developed in-house.,,No,,,Yes,USGS Fundamental Science Practicies Policies,No,No,Yes,,,"Documentation is complete: Documentation exists regarding the maintenance, composition, quality, and intended use of the training and evaluation data, as well as any statistical bias across model features and protected groups.

[Un]supervised clustering of [non-]earthquake signals commonly recorded on regional seismic networks,Department of the Interior,DOI,USGS,Mission-Enabling,,None of the above.,"Surficial mass movements (SMMs), such as landslides and rockfalls, have seismic signatures distinct from other routinely recorded seismic sources like earthquakes and explosions. However, overlaps between the characteristics of these signals can still make it difficult to discriminate between source types during operational seismic monitoring. This ambiguity motivates the development of automated techniques for seismic signal classification. Furthermore, seismic differentiation within the broad class of SMMs has additional scientific and rapid response value. Examination of SMM seismic waveforms highlights a particularly strong contrast between the signals produced by primarily vertical processes versus processes that have a non-negligible horizontal component such as landslides and avalanches. A machine learning (ML) classification scheme is being investigated for differentiating between seismic signals generated by falls versus slides. Additionally included are shallow earthquakes and blasts because these are most similar to SMM signals and are commonly recorded on regional seismic networks. These classes, therefore, are the most useful for automated classification. Test datasets derive from waveform picks in the Exotic Seismic Events Catalog, a diverse collection of non-earthquake seismogenic surface events, and the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) Comprehensive Earthquake Catalog. In development is a shallow, feature-based approach to classification using statistical metrics extracted from waveforms.

Data-driven approaches to filling missing time-series data within the San Francisco Bay-Delta,Department of the Interior,DOI,USGS,Mission-Enabling,,None of the above.,"In measurements of natural systems, incomplete time-series data are the rule, not the exception. Environmental time-series data may suffer from gaps at a variety of time scales, significantly reducing the number of observations to understand phenomena, identify change, calibrate models, and predict future behavior. Data may be missing because of sensor degradation (e.g., biofouling, mechanical issues, power failure), failure to meet basic quality assurance checks, or resampling of paired observations to a common timestamp.

Decades of water-quality time-series data (e.g., turbidity, salinity, temperature) collected throughout the San Francisco Bay-Delta (SFBD) by a variety of agencies including USGS, CA DWR, USBR, USFWS, and USACE are used as a critical indicator of estuary health. These data are no exception to the rule and contain numerous gaps. While bad data points can be relatively straightforward to identify (e.g., as anomalously high or low values), they are challenging to replace and are often flagged and left blank, which can bias long-term observational records.

We will test and develop several (~5) proposed methods to fill gaps in water-quality time-series data and quantify the uncertainty in those estimates. The methods will range in complexity, from linear regression to machine learning and deep learning approaches (Lepot and others, 2017), and will characterize uncertainty in the filled data (Cox and others, 2003).  For this proposal, we will initially restrict our scope to turbidity data, because of the relatively high biofouling rate of the optical sensors typically used to measure turbidity, as well as its ecological significance. In addition, we are already actively implementing one of the methods to fill gaps in turbidity data collected in a south S.F.

Data-driven approaches to filling missing time-series data within the San Francisco Bay-Delta,Department of the Interior,DOI,USGS,Mission-Enabling,,None of the above.,"In measurements of natural systems, incomplete time-series data are the rule, not the exception. Environmental time-series data may suffer from gaps at a variety of time scales, significantly reducing the number of observations to understand phenomena, identify change, calibrate models, and predict future behavior. Data may be missing because of sensor degradation (e.g., biofouling, mechanical issues, power failure), failure to meet basic quality assurance checks, or resampling of paired observations to a common timestamp.

Decades of water-quality time-series data (e.g., turbidity, salinity, temperature) collected throughout the San Francisco Bay-Delta (SFBD) by a variety of agencies including USGS, CA DWR, USBR, USFWS, and USACE are used as a critical indicator of estuary health. These data are no exception to the rule and contain numerous gaps. While bad data points can be relatively straightforward to identify (e.g., as anomalously high or low values), they are challenging to replace and are often flagged and left blank, which can bias long-term observational records.

We will test and develop several (~5) proposed methods to fill gaps in water-quality time-series data and quantify the uncertainty in those estimates. The methods will range in complexity, from linear regression to machine learning and deep learning approaches (Lepot and others, 2017), and will characterize uncertainty in the filled data (Cox and others, 2003).  For this proposal, we will initially restrict our scope to turbidity data, because of the relatively high biofouling rate of the optical sensors typically used to measure turbidity, as well as its ecological significance. In addition, we are already actively implementing one of the methods to fill gaps in turbidity data collected in a south S.F.

Rangeland Condition Monitoring Assessment and Projection (RCMAP),Department of the Interior,DOI,USGS,Mission-Enabling,,None of the above.,"Rangelands, comprised of open grasslands and/or shrublands, occupy huge swathes of land in the US, typically where climate and/or soils are too harsh for either forest or agriculture. Rangeland ecosystems provide critical wildlife habitat (e.g., greater sage grouse, pronghorn, black-footed ferret), forage for livestock, carbon sequestration, provision of water resources, and recreational opportunities. At the same time, rangelands are vulnerable to climate change, fire, and anthropogenic disturbances. The arid-semiarid climate in most rangelands fluctuates widely, impacting livestock forage availability, wildlife habitat, and water resources. Many of these changes can be subtle or evolve over long time periods, responding to climate, anthropogenic, and disturbance driving forces. To address the need for long-term tracking of vegetation change, scientists from the USGS and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) developed the Rangeland Condition Monitoring Assessment and Projection (RCMAP) project. RCMAP provides maps of vegetation cover at yearly time-steps, a critical refence to advancing science in the BLM and assessing Landscape Health standards. RCMAP quantifies the percent cover of ten rangeland components (annual herbaceous, bare ground, herbaceous, litter, non-sagebrush shrub, perennial herbaceous, sagebrush, shrub, and tree cover and shrub height) at yearly time-steps across the western U.S. using field training data, Landsat imagery, and machine learning.",Outputs were not documented and DOI will update the use cases once additional data is collected from submitter,Operation and Maintenance,Neither,,,,,Developed in-house.,,No,,,Yes,USGS Fundamental Science Practicies Policies,No,No,Yes,,,"Documentation is complete: Documentation exists regarding the maintenance, composition, quality, and intended use of the training and evaluation data, as well as any statistical bias across model features and protected groups.

Global Food Security-Support Analysis Data (GFSAD) Project,Department of the Interior,DOI,USGS,Mission-Enabling,,None of the above.,"Climate variability and ballooning populations are putting unprecedented pressure on agricultural croplands and their water use, which are vital for ensuring global food and water security in the twenty-first century. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, military conflicts, and changing diets have added to looming global food insecurity. Therefore, there is a critical need to produce consistent and accurate global cropland products at fine spatial resolution (e.g., farm-scale, 30m or better), which are generated consistently, accurately, and routinely (e.g., every year).

Therefore, the overarching goal of this continuity NASA MEaSUREs (Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments) proposal is to develop a comprehensive global food security-support analysis data (GFSAD) project that will produce multiple cropland models, maps, and monitoring tools leading to a wide array of products using machine learning algorithms (MLAs), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and satellite sensor big-data analytics through cloud-computing. The GFSAD project, will produce four distinct Landsat-derived global cropland products. These products are:
1. Global Cropland Extent Product @ 30m (LGCEP30-2020, LGCEP30-2025).
2. Global Rainfed and Irrigated Product @ 30m (LGRIP30-2020, LGRIP30-2025).
3. Global Cropping Intensity Product @ 30m (LGCIP30-2020 & LGRIP30-2025) &
4. Global Crop Type Product @ 30m for USA, Canada, and India (LGCTY30-2020USACAN, LGCTY30-2025USACAN; LGCTY30-2020India, LGCTY30-2025India).

From some experimenting with the web interface it seems the doi-hosted chatgpt does a great job extracting this sort of information with relatively simple prompts. We were hoping to use this programmatically to more systematically parse information in our geologic map synthesis database. At present, this is ~10k descriptions that consist of on average ~250 characters of text, and I would seek to run a few prompt versions on each unit (plus some testing) - so perhaps a few 10s of thousands of requests.

The CFOI Record Matching programs matches records from various sources, including Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Information System (OIS) files, news articles, and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), to identify missing or inconsistent data in CFOI.

The CFOI Record Matching programs use various aspects of AI in the areas of natural language processing and record matching. The CFOI-OIS matching uses random forest classifier model trained on previously matched CFOI-OIS data. The CFOI-QCEW matching uses TF-IDF vectors and cosine similarity to match establishment names in the CFOI-QCEW data. And the CFOI-CPDMS matching uses a publicly available, third-party question-answering language model to identify relevant CFOI elements from CPDMS data and then uses random forest classifier model to match CPDMS data to CFOI data.

CPS OTC Prediction,Department of Labor,DOL,BLS,Mission-Enabling (internal agency support),N/A,None of the above.,"The BLS productivity office publishes measures of hours worked by major sector and industry. As part of the calculation for this measure, BLS uses Current Employment Statistics (CES) data on hours paid is used to estimate hours for payroll workers. Additional adjustments are made to this measure, such as removing paid time off (PTO), adding off-the-clock (OTC) hours, and adding in hours worked by self-employed and unpaid family workers. BLS uses the Current Population Survey (CPS) dataset to identify the amount of hours that are worked off-the-clock (OTC) by workers. There are some workers in the CPS dataset that do not report whether their time off was paid, or whether they get paid hourly or not. This data needs to be imputed to calculate the ratio of total hours worked to paid hours worked. A random forest model is used to predict the responses for workers that did not report this information by training it on characteristics (such as industry, occupation, education level, age, etc.) of respondents that have reported that information. The benefit of this AI use case is increased accuracy.","

Sample Refinement: Frame API,Department of Labor,DOL,BLS,Mission-Enabling (internal agency support),N/A,None of the above.,"BLS establishment-based surveys, such as the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII), the National Compensation Survey (NCS), and the Occupational Requirements Survey (ORS), use the Longitudinal Database (LDB) as the frame for their survey samples. For each of these programs, there is a significant time-lag between when the sample is drawn for a program and when data collection begins. A critical and time-consuming part of data collection is sample refinement: checking the latest Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) and LDB data to adjust for any changes to the sampled establishment during that time-lag. The QCEW/LDB Frame API allows fast retrieval of the latest QCEW/LDB data for a nationwide sample so that users can perform sample refinement more efficiently. The SOII program uses the Frame API to perform over 20 sample refinement comparison checks, which outputs a report for the data collectors.

The Frame API uses TF-IDF vectors and cosine similarity to compare company names, mailing addresses, and unit descriptions between the survey sample and the latest QCEW/LDB data to determine what components may have changed. The Frame API also has the flexibility for the users to match records using other combinations of variables.

Several potential use cases are possible with the addition of CoPilot into the product which is anticipated in upcoming releases within our GCC tenant.  Our proposed use of AI tools is limited in scope the Agency’s existing security boundary, data and Authority to Operate (ATO).

The expected benefits are faster answers to common questions about the nature of EPA's security and IT infrastructure environment.  We will be able to more effectively leverage the voluminous amount of data currently collected by Purview, Microsoft Security Center, and Defender agents to make decision in a more expedited fashion.  We will be able to act on results more quickly to help reduce security vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

","a.	Security and infrastructure analysts will be able to use CoPilot to better understand and report on existing security vulnerabilities on Microsoft Windows devices. Purview currently delivers canned reports in our dashboard which shows existing vulnerabilities.  CoPilot can be queried to ask specific questions about the vulnerabilities, such as which computers are impacted and the potential mitigation strategy for specific vulnerabilities.
b.	CoPilot can be used to analyze and report on installed software, reporting on potential vulnerabilities and versions for each package.
c.	CoPilot can describe and summarize Data Loss Prevention (DLP) alerts that require Agency attention and help analysts to understand which types of sensitive data are triggering alerts and to improve our models.
d.	CoPilot can quickly respond to common questions about the environment without writing custom reports:  how many Windows 22H2 computers are in the environment?  How many systems are missing the latest Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) client?  How many computers are still unpatched for the Log4J vulnerability?

Employees and IT professionals rely on this platform to obtain service, submit incidents, obtain reports and trends, and plan workloads and priorities to solve problems.  Our proposed use of AI tools is limited in scope the Agency’s existing security boundary, data and ATO.  The expected benefits are reduced numbers of service tickets and calls which will have a direct cost reduction.  Help desk and IT professionals throughout the agency will be able to leverage the vast trove of knowledge articles, asset inventory and history of hundreds of thousands of service tickets to find answers to challenging (and common) IT issues facing our workforce.","Several use cases have emerged to leverage ServiceNow's upcoming AI tools for employees to engage with an AI agent to ask technical questions to solve specific technical issues.  

For example:
b.	An employee may ask, how do I reset my password; the answer will provide a written response with steps based on our existing internal knowledge articles and a link to the Agency’s self-service password management page at pss.epa.gov.  This could divert thousands of calls away from service desk agents each year.
c.	A service desk agent may ask, how do I troubleshoot a problem a customer reports with the error message at Windows login, “domain not found.”  The response would be a list of steps both the technician and employee will need to preform to resolve the error.  This will save the technician a significant amount of time to search the ServiceNow knowledge articles, read the contents and relay instructions to the customer.
d.	A manager may ask the AI agent, how many computers in Region 10 require updates to the latest version of Windows 11 23H2?  How many installations of Adobe Acrobat (pro) are installed in HQ?  How many Dell Latitude 5340 computer have expired warranties agency-wide, provide a detailed list including service tags?

This application scans aerial imagery and uses object detection and image classification models to detect onsite sewage facilities. Initial work is focusing on the ability to identify known systems.

 The intent of this project is to identify failed systems, which can be sources of soil and drinking water contamination as well as vectors that carry or transmit disease in the community. This project will allow STLT partners to readily characterize the location and functional status of septic systems without the time and resource consuming effort of visiting each household. The resources in many local health districts (LHDs) are barely adequate to undertake assessments of suitability  for new systems (if not entirely contracted out) and most LHDs do not have any program to routinely inspect current systems. If successful, this project will allow state, tribal, local, and territorial public health departments to more easily identify failing septic systems and work to address them.  If successful, subsequent work will work on differentiating functional from failed systems.

The School Closure Awareness System,Department of Health and Human Services,HHS,CDC,Emergency Management,,None of the above.,"Identifying unplanned school closures. CDC is responsible for supporting schools before, during, and after and emergency. During COVID 19 this included monitoring school closure or virtual status and reporting this to federal partners, the White House, and the public. Due to cost the process used during COVID was no longer feasible and ceased in DEC 2022. We explored multiple ways to capture this data and our current system met the need best. 

This AI has allowed us to save nearly 2-million-dollars from contracting fees and decrease human work hours by 200 hours. It has made the capture of some of this data possible after cessation of the process used during COVID 19 which we could no longer support. The AI supported system is faster and captures more information about individual closures than the original human-powered process.","This system uses publicly available Facebook posts from approximately 40,000 school or district Facebook accounts. Then uses a large language model to categorize posts as unplanned school closure for several types of events (weather, health, facility issues, safety). It also will denote the type of status change (full closure, virtual, hybrid, or early / late dismissal).

Using Generative AI for Stance Analysis of Public Comments on CDC’s Proposed Rules,Department of Health and Human Services,HHS,CDC,Mission-Enabling (internal agency support),,None of the above.,"By law, Public comments are required to be manually review for any notice of public rule making. These comments are highly labor intensive due to both the quantity and wide range of potential opinions shared by the public. These comments can range in both length of response and quantity serving as a challenge for properly ensuring the insights from the public are accurately gathered in the review process. By using an LLM based Topic Modeling approach, manual reviewers can organize responses based upon theme to enhance both the insights gained, the speed of manual review, and ensure all topics mentioned can be accurately reported in all review processes. This process can use open source python libraries and open-source LLMs to complete different actions.

 As public feedback on various rules gets collected across the CDC’s divisions, this initiative along with other NLP approaches can potentially save time for CDC’s public policy experts during public comment review. ","Reviewing the public comments currently involves a manual review process that necessitates a high level of time and effort on the part of regulatory analysts. To improve the process of reviewing public comments as part of regulatory analysis, our team implemented topic modeling (Grootendorst et al., 2022) and sentiment analysis (Hartman et al., 2023) of comments published to the new amendment to foreign quarantine regulation published by CDC on July 10, 2023. This solution expands these efforts by using generative AI models  to try for capture stance expressed in each comment.

Our aim is to input all dataset documentation and metadata into an index with the goal of creating a virtual assistant. This assistant offers support to our HIV researchers by providing the information they seek from the data and potentially generating SAS, R, or Python code for desired variable names. For instance, if we require a dataset containing HIV PrEP information, we can request it to generate a list of current datasets that contain data on PrEP medication usage in 2019, along with the associated variable names. Subsequently, we can instruct it to produce lines of code, such as a logistic regression, which can be readily copied and pasted into our analysis software of choice.

This project will impact public health by improving the efficiency of dissemination of information through production of key takeaways which can then be quickly reviewed by SMEs and cleared. This project will also allow for improved understanding of limitations and uncertainties in use of AI methods that could contribute to improved implementation of such methods in public health.","The goal of this solution is to evaluate how AI can be implemented in the process of summarizing subject matter expert (SME) interpretations/knowledge to improve efficiency in knowledge dissemination during a response.  As part of the proof-of-concept, we  seek to evaluate the limitations and uncertainties of AI methods in this use-case, such as bias and hallucinations as such issues will require mitigation before this method can be broadly adopted. Our proposed approach would make use of the ChatGPT interface through EDAV (or alternative accepted platform) as our prompts will include uncleared data from the Respiratory Virus Response (RVR). In this response,  SMEs from different groups provide bulleted information that then needs to be further summarized to address key takeaways.

Semi-Automated Nonresponse Detection for Surveys (SANDS),Department of Health and Human Services,HHS,CDC,Mission-Enabling (internal agency support),,None of the above.,"SANDS is a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) designed to assist with human-in-the-loop procedures specifically for open-ended survey responses. Open-ended survey responses vary in quality and are challenging to use effectively because they are labor-intensive to review and therefore cost-prohibitive to use at scale. SANDS is intended to reduce the burden by filtering out clear and obvious non-response such as  ""This is so dumb, why I am I wasting my time on such a stupid question"" or ""Because It is true"" which provide no value to researchers. This LLM is available on HuggingFace and is not routinely updated, but it can be used like any open-source LLM through secure instances of Python.

Sequential Coverage Algorithm (SCA) and partial Expectation-Maximization (EM) estimation in Record Linkage,Department of Health and Human Services,HHS,CDC,Health & Medical,,None of the above.,"CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Data Linkage Program has developed a record linkage program designed to maximize the scientific value of the Center’s population-based surveys. Linked data files enable researchers to examine the factors that influence disability, chronic disease, health care utilization, morbidity, and mortality. The linkage algorithms initially used by the program did not implement machine learning in either deterministic or probabilistic linkages and required several manual steps for these processes. 

Using machine learning in the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Data Linkage Program offers several benefits. Machine learning algorithms help improve the accuracy and efficiency of data linkage by developing joining methods or blocking groups.  Working with very large datasets can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. By implementing supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, the Data Linkage Program can automate the process of developing and selecting blocking groups, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency. This additionally improves the scalability of data linkages. Machine learning algorithms can continuously learn and adapt based on new data inputs and feedback. This allows the Data Linkage Program to refine their linkage algorithms over time.","CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Data Linkage Program has implemented both supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) techniques in their linkage algorithms.

Creation of synthetic Survey-like Insurance Names for use coding NHIS private insurance responses,Department of Health and Human Services,HHS,CDC,Health & Medical,,None of the above.,"This solution will impact the process of manual coding and reviewing text errors in the National Health Interview Survey 

Previous efforts to augment the manual coding have proven ineffective. Given the complex nature of insurance programs, this results in over 200 FTE hours a year being spent on just the initial coding of open text insurance fields. Additional hours are spent reviewing the manual coding for errors. By creating survey-like insurance responses, this could theoretically save over 100 hours of staff labor a year, greatly increasing efficiency and timeliness.","The National Health Interview Survey calculates insurance coverage rates among the US non-institutionalized resident population, including statistics of the percentage of people with private insurance coverage. The collection of information on insurance coverage is accomplished in two parts. First, survey respondents self-identify the type of insurance they have. Secondly, to aid in the verification of insurance type, survey respondents also provide the name of the health plan or program they have in an open text field. The information collected in the open text field may include misspellings, acronyms, and rarely match exactly the true complete insurance plan name. 

This leads to a time intensive process as staff may need to decipher the plan name in the open text field mentioned by the respondent and/or abbreviated by the interviewer and if that plan name confirms the correct type of insurance initially indicated during the interview process. By creating AI generated known acronyms as data points for projects, as an example Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama to BCBS of AL and BC/BS of AL, this will create a more representative set of information for staff to use when coding potential saving up to hundreds of FTE hours reviewing responses. This also works in combination with existing efforts to augment manual coding with AI and Machine Learning to increase efficiency.

CLASP Coverage Planning & Scheduling,National Aeronautics and Space Administration,NASA,Jet Propulsion Laboratory,Statistical Methods,None,None of the above.,"The Compressed Large-scale Activity Scheduling and Planning (CLASP) project is a long-range scheduler for space-based or aerial instruments that can be modeled as pushbrooms 1D line sensors dragged across the surface of the body being observed. It addresses the problem of choosing the orientation and on/off times of a pushbroom instrument or collection of pushbroom instruments such that the schedule covers as many target points as possible, but without oversubscribing memory and energy. Orientation and time of observation is derived from geometric computations that CLASP performs using the SPICE ephemeris toolkit.  CLASP allows mission planning teams to start with a baseline mission concept and simulate the mission's science return using models of science observations, spacecraft operations, downlink, and spacecraft trajectory. This analysis can then be folded back into many aspects of mission design -- including trajectory, spacecraft design, operations concept, and downlink concept. The long planning horizons allow this analysis to span an entire mission.  Actively in use for optimized scheduling for the NISAR Mission, ECOSTRESS mission (study of water needs for plant areas), EMIT mission (mineralogy of arid dusty regions), OCO-3 (atmospheric CO2) and more as well as used for numerous missions analysis and studies (e.g. 100+).","Estimates of scientific mission outcomes / results, based on optimized scheduling of spacecraft and sensors.",In mission,Neither,1/1/2006,1/1/2006,1/1/2018,NA,Developed with both contracting and in-house resources.,NA,No,NA,None,No,NASA's data stewardship best practices are in effect under guidance from the Chief Data Officer.,No,No,Yes,Blank/Not Provided,Mission planning and execution data from multiple missions.,Yes,N/A,,Yes,Yes,NA,No.  Engineering Review and Resease instead.,Deployed on multiple remote sensing spacecraft,,No,,N/A,,,,This capability has been re-used among many missions,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The M2020 onboard scheduler incrementally constructs a feasible schedule by iterating through activities in priority-first order. When considering each activity it computes the valid time intervals for placement, taking into account preheating, maintenance heating, and wake/sleep of the rover as required. After an activity is placed (other than a preheat/maintenance or wake/sleep), the activity is never reconsidered by the scheduler for deletion or moving. Therefore the scheduler can be considered non backtracking, and only searches in the sense that it computes valid timeline intervals for legal activity placement.  Meta Search: Because the onboard scheduler will be invoked many times in a given sol (Martian Day) with a range of possible contexts (due to execution variations), its non backtracking nature leaves its vulnerable to brittleness.

USA Class,Office of Personnel Management,OPM,HRS/HRSES/Federal Classification Center,Mission-Enabling,,,"The purpose of this project is to build an application to help managers and HR specialists (classifiers) improve the quality and speed the development of position descriptions (PDs). Developing a PD can be a lengthy process that requires significant back-and-forth between managers and classifiers. The length of time required to develop a PD is often cited as a major pain point and bottleneck in federal hiring, workforce planning, organizational design, and performance management processes. To address the challenge today, managers will simply copy whole PDs or significant sections of PDs which weakens the accuracy of the new PD. Agencies have also turned to the use of “standard” PDs which tend to be too generic to be effective for use in recruitment and performance.

This project seeks to solve the “blank-page-syndrome” by suggesting draft major duties, factor evaluation statements, and other elements of the PD for managers and classifiers to use to develop PDs that meet classification standards.

This project is expected to significantly decrease the time required to develop PDs, leading to a decrease in time to hire and other related HR processes. A decrease in the time to hire means agencies can be more competitive in attracting top talent to their organizations, enhancing their ability to meet their missions. A decrease in the time required to develop position descriptions is also expected to lead to cost savings for agencies – freeing up manager and HR specialist time for other tasks. Additionally, the streamlined generation of PDs will enable agencies to move away from “standard” PD processes which will allow for better organizational design and workforce planning outcomes. The project is expected to also lead to higher-quality PDs that adhere to classification standards. This will improve position and performance management and talent acquisition in agencies, ensuring organizations are structured and staffed appropriately to meet their missions.
","USA Class will provide draft PD content generated through large language models (LLMs) and informed by a PD library curated by OPM experts and user responses to prompt questions about the position’s purpose, regular and recurring work, and knowledge required. The questions are intended to be straightforward and easily answered by the manager in a few minutes. The application will then send this information in a prompt to the LLM and generates suggested major duty titles and work tasks. The user (manager or classifier) can edit the draft content suggested by the system and makes the decision whether to include it in the PD or not. Future iterations will include a certification by a classifier and others that they accept/approve the final content of the full PD.",Acquisition and/or Development,"Rights-Impacting

USA Class could produce incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent suggestions due to limitations in training data or other gaps.

Simulation of the Nation (SimoN) Synthetic Data Engine,Department of the Treasury,TREAS,Internal Revenue Service,Mission-Enabling,,None of the above.,"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Enterprise Services (ES), Enterprise Systems Testing (EST) is the testing authority for Information Technology (IT) and provides enterprise-wide testing solutions and critical support across the enterprise for numerous systems and applications.  

The Synthetic Data Engine, or Simulation of the Nation (SimoN) is designed to generate volumes of synthetic tax data to represent a wide range of use cases, without copying Federal Tax Information (FTI) from production systems is an IRS directive.  SimoN is also able to age data to support multi-year tax code concerns for more comprehensive testing sequences spanning multiple tax years. This will improve the volume, diversity and quality of test data being created and processed in a systemic manner. To date, SimoN has produced over 700,000 unique and valid Individual Master File (IMF) tax returns, and over 50,000 unique and valid Business Master File (BMF) returns for testing. SimoN also supports Social Security Administration (SSA) interconnects and SS4 interconnects which allow the data produced to be fully linked between business and individuals. Over 320 dimensions of socioeconomic data are synthesized and validated against United States (U.S.) Census metrics to ensure a validated and realistic synthetic dataset. 

The SimoN solution consumes publicly available statistical data about businesses and the population of the U.S. This includes tax household composition, income and education levels and other data points. The solution combines statistical data with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to generate businesses and simulated households with a variety of tax scenarios. The solution then stores the business and population data in a database.  The data is extracted to files for submission to the test environment systems simulating eFile and SSA feeds with no review of data created.

At no point, is Production data (i.e., Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Federal Taxpayer Information (FTI) or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) used as input to the Artificial Intelligence/Machine Language (AI/ML) process of SimoN, nor does the simulated output data feed Production systems. In addition to generating synthetic data, this system is designed to simulate the aging of the population. The aging model includes a variety of socioeconomic events, such as births, deaths, marriages, job changes and address changes. SimoN also has multiple levels of automated testing and data validations to ensure the data produced is usable by IRS test systems and simulates businesses and population.","SimoN is capable of outputting 3 tax years of IMF and BMF returns starting in Tax Year 2022. With each XML Schema Definition (XSD) that is released under the Modernized e-File (MeF), SimoN implements each XSD version and provides full regression support for testing in successive years. Each XSD version has automated tests that run to ensure verifications can be run to reduce the likelihood of AI generated synthetic returns that might have data anomalies. 

Also, to help seed test systems with synthetic individuals and synthetic businesses, SimoN can output the Data Master 1 (DM1) file simulating a feed from Social Security Administration (SSA) and Application for Employer Identification Number file (Form SS-4) containing transcribed form information so that the test system can be initialized with the appropriate backend reference data for validation of IMF and BMF entities, as well as the ability to validate incoming synthetic tax returns.",Operation and Maintenance,Neither,4/4/2021,10/1/2021,1/31/2024,,Developed with contracting resources.,2032H5-22-C-00097,No,,,No,,No,Yes,No,,"None, all data used for unsupervised model training is based on public data sets from the Census Bureau.","Documentation is complete: Documentation exists regarding the maintenance, composition, quality, and intended use of the training and evaluation data, as well as any statistical bias across model features and protected groups.","Marital Status, Residency Status, Employment Status, Income, Other, Sex/Gender, Age, Socioeconomic Status, Ability Status",SimoN leverages over 100 different census attributes for model training in order to generate a synthetic population.,Yes,"Yes – agency has access to source code, but it is not public.",,No,,6-12 months,Yes,,No,,No,,None: This use case does not re-use any internally developed tooling or managed infrastructure from any other AI development efforts within the agency.,Limited documentation for review: Some information regarding the model’s performance on specific benchmarks are available or have been shared with specific stakeholders within the agency.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Modernization Accelerator - Legacy Applications Chatbot & Code Conversion,Department of the Treasury,TREAS,Internal Revenue Service,Mission-Enabling,,None of the above.,"The IRS Enterprise has many systems that use a legacy coding language, which is much older than typical modern coding languages. This makes it difficult to find skilled and knowledgeable people to maintain or modernize applications. A large language model (LLM) can help speed up this translation so we can more rapidly modernize while retaining the functional objectives of the legacy code. This use case will consist of an iterative multi-phase approach to help accelerate the modernization of sample legacy code by building a Generative AI (GenAI) Sandbox environment that will allow us to ingest a subset of IRS legacy documentation to build a LLM GenAI chatbot. This will accelerate knowledge discovery for future legacy modernization initiatives. In addition, we will leverage GenAI to ingest a subset of IRS Assembler Language Code (ALC) legacy code to evaluate, validate, and optimize GenAI capabilities to not only transform legacy code into English readable pseudocode, and convert it into a modern language. This initial use case will be limited to IRS use only within a sandbox environment and not intended for production.

Modernization Accelerator - International Business Machines (IBM) Cognitive Data Mapper (CDM) and AWS SageMaker+LLAMA,Department of the Treasury,TREAS,Internal Revenue Service,Mission-Enabling,,None of the above.,"The Business Masterfile Modernization (BMF Mod) project will reproduce the legacy BMF system, written in 60-year-old mainframe technology, into a modern, cloud-based system. BMF Mod will also add additional features to the system as new technology permits.

Note that this software will only be used in an isolated development (sandbox) environment, to assist developers in programming the new modernized system. It will not be promoted into Production. 

These Artificial Intelligence/Machine Language (AI/ML) tools analyze the existing legacy BMF system code, after it has been prepared by other non-AI/ML International Business Machines (IBM) tools, to automatically produce: Business logic in natural language, which describe what actions or data transformations the code performs: Modernized Java code to implement the business rules; Microservice recommendations, meaning that code snippets are grouped together by function and access patterns, to split very large programs that are hard to understand into smaller chunks that can be more easily maintained.

These tools take in code from the existing BMF system, after it has been prepared by other non-AI/ML IBM tools, and analyze the code to produce the business logic, code, and microservice recommendations.
IBM Cognitive Data Mapper (CDM) uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) Machine Learning (ML) models to automatically analyze the source system's data and metadata, map to a target model or business glossary, and/or classify the information. CDM will be used for automated data mapping to automatically identify and establish relationships between data elements in different data sources and source systems.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) SageMaker with LLAMA accepts prepared code from other non-AI/ML IBM tools, then further analyzes the code to extract business logic and convert the code to modern Java.

The tools analyze existing code from the BMF system, which are very large programs, and suggest how to translate the code into smaller, more manageable and understandable business logic, code, and microservices.

All output business logic, code, and microservice recommendations will be reviewed by both IBM and IRS employees prior to being used in development of the new modernized BMF system. The outputs will be put into a spreadsheet that can be shared with subject matter experts, who will then manually check accuracy of the work. Code will also be packaged and extensively tested to ensure accuracy.

These AI/ML tools will accelerate our development process, allowing us to deliver a modernized system a few years faster than otherwise. The output business logic and microservice recommendations are also very useful as documentation artifacts, helping to understand how the BMF system functions.

Approval will allow BMF Mod work to continue. Without approval we would need to extend our modernization plans to account for performing these functions manually.

While these AI/ML tools are only intended to be used by IBM consultants working on the BMF Mod program, its impacts will benefit all BMF stakeholders including IRS business operating divisions, Treasury, and taxpayers.","IBM CDM uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) Machine Learning (ML) models to automatically analyze the source system's data and metadata, map to a target model or business glossary, and/or classify the information.

Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Generative AI Chatbot Proof of Concept,Department of the Treasury,TREAS,Internal Revenue Service,Mission-Enabling,,Searching for information using AI.,"The objective of this AI project is to investigate the feasibility and applicability of using Large Learning Model, Retrieval-Augmented Generation AI technology to consolidate multiple sources of designated IRS publicly facing information into a simple question and answer tool.  It accomplishes this purpose by using a select data set to retrieve answers for questions asked by a small subset of Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) personnel during tax preparation (this is the Proof of Concept's use case). Currently, volunteers have to know where to go to find the information for which they are looking, across multiple, detailed documents.  This includes publications, forms, certification training guides, etc.   Once they determine which document to use, then they have to search for answer within that document.  This model uses the information provided (designated, publicly available IRS publications) to search for an answer and shows the user what document the information came from as well as the page.  This saves the user a lot of time and effort.  This model has been tested by two separate groups with a 99.5% accuracy rate for answers to questions asked.  Humans were very involved in the development and testing of this chatbot to ensure answers were correct, accurate and relevant to the questions asked. The chatbot was built with a survey-type feature whereby each answer is scored by the volunteer for the previously mentioned criteria.  The questions, answers, scores, and comments (feedback) from the volunteers is recorded within the chatbot for review and analysis to make further adjustments or fine tuning of the chatbot.  Chatbot input that resembles Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is blocked, so users cannot ask questions that include any form of PII.  The benefits of this proof-of-concept chatbot and this specific technology are to decrease the time and effort to prepare taxes (by using an IRS reference tool) and the volunteers will be able to provide more efficient service for taxpayers.  During initial Subject Matter Expert (SME) user testing, it was discovered some volunteers are already using publicly available Generative AI (GenAI) tools to find information.  This information is coming from all sources in the web-world, or wherever that GenAI tool is directed for information gathering.  The free Google Gemini tool is one of the examples a SME tester referenced.  If the IRS VITA GenAI chatbot tool is using information the IRS provides as the ONLY data source it uses as reference to provide an answer, the volunteer will know it is the correct answer, instead of the volunteer using a tool of their choice and assuming the answer is correct. This is a proof of concept and will expire at the end of the upcoming tax season (April 2025), The population impacted is a small number of VITA volunteers who have already been Certified under the VITA program and who Taxpayer Services and who agree to participate in the proof of concept to help determine its usefulness and applicability.  Stakeholder Partnerships, Education and Communication has vetted and asked to test while they are preparing taxes for those eligible under the VITA/Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) Programs.  The number will not exceed 30 testers.",chatbot-generated answers (to user-entered prompts; aka questions),Acquisition and/or Development,Neither,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long-term impacts of land-use/land-cover dynamics on surface water quality in Botswana’s reservoirs using satellite data and artificial intelligence methods: Case study of the Botswana’s Limpopo River Basin (1984-2019),United States Agency for International Development,USAID,"USAID/Bureau for Inclusive Growth, Partnerships, and Innovation",Science & Space,,None of the above.,"For water supply, semi-arid Botswana relies on the reservoirs within the Botswana’s LRB. Reservoirs are particularly susceptible to the negative impacts of land-use and land-cover (LULC) activities and runoff because of their complex dynamics, relatively longer water residence times, and their role as an integrating sink for pollutants from their drainage basins. Despite these interrelationships and significance in regional and global economic stability, land and water (L-W) are often treated in “silos”. To understand the complex L-W nexus within the LRB, this study will use data-driven artificial intelligence for quantitative determination of the relationships between LULC change, together with socioeconomic development indicators and climate change, and their impacts on water quality and availability within the basin, both for 1984-2019 and to predict future scenarios (2020-2050). To advance data acquisition for LULC analysis and climate change, the study utilizes optical Earth-observation and meteorological satellite data. To provide near real-time and cost-effective approach for continuous monitoring of reservoir water quality within the basin, the study will develop empirical models for water quality estimation and water quality index mapping using 35-years of in-situ water quality measurements and water spectral observations using drone-borne spectrometer and optical satellite imagery through regression modeling and geospatial methods.","Reports, visualizations",Retired,Neither,7/13/1905,7/13/1905,7/13/1905,7/15/1905,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-Money Laundering and Shareholders Transparency IT System,United States Agency for International Development,USAID,USAID/Moldova,Diplomacy & Trade,,None of the above.,"The implemented Anti-Money Laundering (AML) system currently relies on a rule-based detection framework with advanced networking capabilities. Building on this foundation, additional machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities are being supported to enhance the accuracy of detection logic. This innovative system, the first of its kind in the region, equips employees of the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) with advanced tools to monitor all banking operations comprehensively. The system supports the NBM’s risk-based approach, enabling the identification of suspicious activities and raising of timely alerts. This supports early detection of money laundering and terrorist financing risks, as well as suspicious changes in the ownership structures of banks. Importantly, the NBM's role is supervisory rather than investigative; the system is not designed for law enforcement or prosecutorial purposes.


As part of the implementation parameter, a ML/AI proof of concept has been developed. This ML/AI use case specifically focuses on enhancing detection ratios by analyzing alert datasets and generating a segmentation scheme through a K-means clustering algorithm. This segmentation helps identify distinct subgroups (e.g., customers, accounts) with varying levels of money laundering risk, thereby refining the detection process and supporting risk-focused oversight.
","The primary output of the AI algorithm is a segmentation scheme, as described above. This scheme categorizes entities based on their risk levels, enabling improved detection logic and risk assessment within the AML framework.",Operation and Maintenance,Neither,4/1/2021,4/1/2021,8/1/2024,,Developed with contracting resources.,72011719F00001,No,,,No,,No,No,Yes,,N/A,"Documentation is missing or not available: No documentation exists regarding maintenance, composition, quality, or intended use of the training and evaluation data.","Gender, other","Address, residency, affiliation with different groups, etc.",Yes,No – agency does not have access to source code.,,No,,,No,,No,,Other,No relevant resources,None: This use case does not re-use any internally developed tooling or managed infrastructure from any other AI development efforts within the agency.,"No documentation is available: No documentation detailing model performance metrics, model architecture, features and intended use of the models have been created or are currently accessible to other data science teams within the agency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use cases for the AI will be reviewed by VA experts and subject matter experts, with the draft use cases requiring technical steps to build, pilot test, and refine.","Smart Responder Chat Bot Use Case #1 – Real time resources for VCL responders   Using machine learning and natural language processing an algorithm will be trained based on feedback from the Veterans Crisis Line staff and crisis line responders to provide real-time prompts of resources to improve the quality of the crisis call. Curated, vetted resources will be prompted by key words for the responder to consider using during a crisis call.   Smart Responder Chat Bot Use Case #2 – AI documentation for VCL responders   To improve the time each Veterans Crisis Line responder spends on documentation during and after a crisis call, natural language processing will be used to listen and document during and after the call. The documentation will be organized to include the topic areas and key points required in documentation and provide a final draft editable by the responder. This use case will; decrease the time spent by responders on documentation, improve the responder workflow for VCL operations, and provide needed downtime away from both answering calls and documentation for responder to debrief with colleagues, accomplish other tasks and take necessary breaks to improve overall responder wellbeing.   Smart Responder Chat Bot Use Case #3 – AI for supervisory support during a call   Using machine learning and natural language processing including sentiment analysis, a chat bot could detect the need for a responder to seek supervisory support. Improving the real-time communication between a VCL responder and their supervisor during a call that is challenging (eg.

Nursing Proficiency Coach & Nurse Proficiency Evaluator...and beyond!,Department of Veterans Affairs,VA,VHA: Veterans Health Administration,Education & Workforce,,None of the above.,"Two custom GPTs have been created: Nurse Proficiency Writer and Nursing Proficiency Coach.  A GS version is in development.  The Nurse GPTs are used to compare the nurse's self-input against 600+ functional statements and standards (externally accessible or approved by the Office of Nursing Service).  It evaluates the nurse's performance against the standards, reports on positive findings, identifies weak areas, provides an estimated rating, and grade assessment.  The interactive GPT allows nurses to have a dialog to better understand how their practice can be improved.   Many of our 90,000+ RNs are not proficient in understanding the standards nor adept in writing performance reports. This leads to end-user frustration, quality issues with content, submission gaps compared to the standard, interrater reliability variances, and a host of other challenges with the our current process. The tool aids the nurses in developing the content for their ePerformance submission.  No PHI is allowed in nursing proficiencies (by standard), and PHII is scrubbed prior to submission by the nurse. ","
The output takes the nurse's input and returns a summary of each practice dimension and positive accomplishments offering suggestions where the nurse can improve.  The tool can help the nurse in generating a written summary for ePerformance submission.  This is a tremendous time saver and improves the quality of their submission.  Most importantly, the Custom GPT does not impact the staff rating.  It is a tool is designed to help the nurse.  The nurse is ultimately responsible for the content and final submission (data accuracy and validity), and the proficiency evaluations are the responsibility of the Supervisor with knowledge regarding the staffs performance.  The improvment in content can greatly assist the Supervisor in their evaluation process (win-win).

Computer Aided Detection (CADe) of Neoplasia during Colonoscopy - “GI Genius”,Department of Veterans Affairs,VA,VHA: Veterans Health Administration,Health & Medical,,None of the above.,"GI Genius™, a commercial product distributed by Medtronic, Inc., is a computer-aided detection module, powered by artificial intelligence, designed to aid endoscopists in detecting colonic mucosal lesions (such as polyps and adenomas) during colonoscopy. The FDA cleared this commercial product in April 2021.
The device physically connects to existing endoscopes, video processors, and display monitors, but does not connect to the VA network.
During endoscopy, the CADe device automatically detects, and highlights suspected neoplastic lesions / polyps in real time. The module was trained and validated with white-light endoscopy videos and continues to be refined with growing datasets. Information about the indications, safety and warnings can be found here: GI Genius™ Intelligent Endoscopy Module - Indications, Safety, and Warnings | Medtronic (https://www.medtronic.com/covidien/en-us/products/gastrointestinal-artificial-intelligence/gi-genius-intelligent-endoscopy/indications-safety-warnings.html)
Multiple studies and meta-analyses have found these devices increase adenoma detection rates, a well-established metric for colonoscopy quality that is related to colon cancer incidence and death. Initial randomized implementation of the devices across VA facilities allowed for a pragmatic evaluation of the impact of these devices on adenoma detection. The evaluation demonstrated that the provision of colonoscopy CADe devices resulted in a statistically significant 21% increase in the odds of adenoma detection and an absolute increase in ADR of approximately 4% compared to colonoscopy without CADe. These devices will improve ADR, which should decrease colorectal cancer incidence and mortality amongst Veterans over time.

The impact of CADe on ADR was moderated by the number of years since an endoscopist’s medical degree (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.00-1.04, p =.04), indicating that ADR improvement with CADe availability was greater for endoscopists with more years since their medical degree. The impact of CADe on ADR was not moderated by endoscopist specialty or sex (p >.05 for both).","Documentation has been partially completed: Some documentation exists (detailing the composition and any statistical bias or measurement skew for training and evaluation purposes), but documentation took place within this use case’s development.","[""Other""]","None.

Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) Clinician Training Simulator,Department of Veterans Affairs,VA,VHA: Veterans Health Administration,Education & Workforce,,None of the above.,"The CAPS-5 Clinician Training Simulator comprises three online courses, available in TMS and TRAIN, that provide instruction in the administration and scoring of the CAPS-5. The courses use voice recognition, 3-D technology, and artificial intelligence to create an immersive learning experience. The courses are intended for clinicians, trainees, researchers, and examiners in VA and in the community. They use AI in the following ways: 1. In the three current CAPS-5 virtual patient courses, learners have the option to speak the prompts, with their spoken prompts transformed to text using speech recognition. 2. The learners’ prompts, whether spoken or typed, are programmatically compared to the required prompts in the CAPS-5. The system analyzes whether the prompts were delivered exactly (“verbatim”), with slight variations (“paraphrased”), or with unacceptable variations (“off-script”). 3. One of the courses analyzes learner prompts in order to trigger comments –corrections or praise -- from a virtual coach. 4. We’re currently revising one of the courses to use generative AI. Here’s how the vendor described it in their response to our solicitation: “This new design will also leverage a separate backend to handle AI multi-agency and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to ensure large language models (LLMs) used will always operate as designed.” This will be a closed system that does not pull information from or input information to publicly-available platforms (e.g., GPT-4, Bard). More information about the three courses and access to them is available at https://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/continuing_ed/caps5_clinician_training.asp.

Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation (STORM) predictive model ,Department of Veterans Affairs,VA,VHA: Veterans Health Administration,Health & Medical,,None of the above.,"The STORM model is a predictive model to estimate risk of a suicide or overdose-related health care event or death in the next year.  The model uses patient level predictors extracted from the patient’s medical records (into the VA’s Corporate Data Warehouse), such as diagnoses, prescriptions, and health care utilization, etc.  
This predictive model is used for three purposes. (1) Primary use case is to identify patients at elevated risk of suicide or overdose-related events for referral to an interdisciplinary team for clinical case review.  This team makes treatment recommendations to share with treating providers and documents them in the medical record. The STORM algorithm is used to identify patients to refer to this program at each facility.  Assignment to this case management program has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality in patients estimated at “very high” risk on the STORM predictive model by 22% in the next 4 months. (2) Secondary use case is to help risk stratify patients based on prior health care interactions to support augmentation of risk mitigation interventions and treatments for patients with patterns of care associated with risk of suicide or overdose events. Risk estimates are provided as a sorting/filtering and informational feature on the STORM clinical decision support system.  This decision support system enables population management of patients prescribed opioids or with opioid use disorders, as well as providing curated information to support treatment planning for individual patients. (3) The last use case is to meet the requirements of the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act (CARA) mandating that clinicians use VA decision support tools to review patient risks prior to initiating opioid therapy for pain.  Direct synchronized links from the VISTA medical record to the STORM report integrate this decision support summary information into clinician workflows as a support for risk assessment before writing and initial opioid prescription.  Each of these use cases is built into existing clinical workflows completed by overlapping, but different health care providers. For use case 1, designated interdisciplinary risk review teams at each health care system use the risk estimates to determine which patient require risk review.  For use case 2, VA health care providers (e.g., opioid prescribers) and teams (e.g., primary care and general mental health teams) use the risk estimates in combination with decision support recommendations of interventions to consider facilitate and augment risk assessment and treatment planning for their patients on opioid analgesics or being treated for opioid use disorder.  For use case 3, VA medication prescribers or their delegated team members use the categorized risk scores in the context of curated descriptive data from the patient’s medical record to review risk factors and consider risk and benefits of treatment options for pain management before prescribing opioids.  Risk considerations are documented in a clinical note for tracking.   Use of STORM is expected to improve decision-making about opioid prescribing and treatment of patients with opioid use disorders, as well as consistency of use of clinical practice guideline recommended treatment practices for safe management of patients exposed to opioids.  STORM also focuses on ensuring recognition of patient risks and facilitating care coordination across treatment providers for complex patients with multiple interacting disorders. By improving use of risk mitigation practices and treatment interventions, we expect STORM will reduce adverse outcomes for patients exposed to opioids.  Program evaluations support this expectation, finding that implementation of the targeted interdisciplinary review requirements associated with use case 1 significantly reduced all cause mortality in the targeted patient population.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10698768/","The STORM predictive model estimates the risk of having an overdose or suicide-related event in next year for all patients currently receiving a VA opioid analgesic prescription with nightly updates.  For all other active VHA patients, the STORM predictive model estimates the hypothetical risk of having an overdose or suicide-related event in next year, if the patient was prescribed or otherwise had access to low, medium, or high dose opioid analgesics.  These risk estimates are provided to clinicians on a family of dashboards, both as percentage likelihood of an event in the next year, and as a categorical grouping of estimated low, medium, high or very high risk.   Paired with this risk estimate is a summary of all risk factors identified and considered in generating the risk estimate for that patient, and recommendations for risk mitigation and treatment options to consider.  These recommendations are tailored based on patient characteristics identified in the medical record (e.g. Medications for opioid use disorder are recommended for patients seen for an opioid use disorder diagnosis) and patient receipt of these interventions is tracked and displayed on the dashboard.  The STORM dashboards are used by clinicians as an informational tool to summarize and organize medical record information to support risk reviews during treatment planning (e.g. when considering an opioid prescription), for management of patients prescribed opioids or treated for opioid use disorder, and for interdisciplinary case reviews of very high risk patients to ensure safe and effective care coordination and treatment planning across health care providers.",Operation and Maintenance,Both,6/1/2012,6/1/2012,6/1/2015,,Developed in-house.,,No,,,No,NA,Yes,Yes,Yes,,"Clinical data came from the VHA National Corporate Data Warehouse, an archival data set that contains comprehensive patient-by-patient, encounter-by-encounter clinical and administrative data derived from the Department of Veterans Affairs’ electronic medical records.

This risk was a concern based on known tendencies of some providers to over-interpret recommendations as requirements.  This tendency was observed in a minority of providers and addressed explicitly in training and training materials moving forward.  (2) The program could be clinically inefficient and use provider time that might be more effectively focused elsewhere.  This is a concern for all VHA clinical programs, and VHA management consistently seeks to optimize clinical time and attention towards achieving the greatest patient benefit.  (3) The program could lead to unfair allocation of clinical resources if the model is biased and other clinical programming does not compensate for areas of model under-performance. Here, a targeted case review is required for patients identified as ""very high"" risk per the STORM predictive model, though all clinical services are available and recommended for all patients based on clinical indication in the STORM decision support system.   After review of the common risks template, the following risks were identified: Fair & Equitable (FE) - Algorithm target not reflective of real-world outcome of interest Response: There is a risk that changes in population exposures and behaviors related to opioids may alter patterns of risk away from those the model was trained on.

VA has responded and clarified misconceptions where concerns have been raised.  Accountable & Monitored (AM) - Performance Efficacy and Fairness (e.g. Model/Data Drift, Model Degradation, or inappropriate application)  Response: This is a risk, model performance is degrading over time and an update is in process. However all identified patients are clinically complex and appropriate for clinical attention.  Accountable & Monitored (AM) - User-Introduced Errors Response: There is a low risk, there is a community of practice and regular monthly education to support proper implementation of the VA opioid safety program, including the STORM decision support system and predictive model.

",No - Some individual decisions or actions require direct human oversight.,,Online - in the terms or instructions for the service.,,Yes,"VA has examined performance of the STORM model for estimating overdose and suicide -related risk among Veterans in VHA care, stratified by patient sex, race and ethnicity.  The first iteration of model performance evaluation is described in List et al., 2023, available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10698768/.   The main finding from this evaluation was that the model tended to underestimate risk in non-white populations in years subsequent to the year the model was trained on.  This underestimation tracked population level changes in opioid overdose rates across this period, as there was a significant increase in observed overdose rates in non-white populations between the model training year and later years.  This finding emphasized the importance of regular updating of the predictive model to address changes in risk contributions in the U.S. population over time.  Additional efforts to optimize bias evaluation methods were undertaken utilizing the STORM model as an example (Meerwijk et al., 2024).  While this evaluation emphasized the complexity of bias evaluation, it also suggested opportunities for improvement of model performance, particularly for older adults, who tend to utilize VHA mental health services less than younger VHA patients. Guided by these findings, VHA is actively working on an update to the STORM predictive model, incorporating a significantly expanded set of candidate predictor variables in hopes of better capturing indications of risk across subpopulations and optimizing the model to reflect evolving trends in opioid exposure and outcomes. As part of this effort, VHA has built a decision support infrastructure to enable remodeling, model evaluation, and model deployment into VHA clinical decision support systems on an annual or as-needed cycle.

Deep-Learning approaches to develop candidate lists of terms for use in text searches ,Department of Veterans Affairs,VA,VHA: Veterans Health Administration,Health & Medical,,None of the above.,"The intended use is to increase the comprehensiveness of term lists to be used in text-matching approaches to identifying concepts of interest in free-text medical record notes. Text-matching approaches are an efficient method for identifying text of interest in medical notes.  The success of text-matching approaches depends on the quality of term lists used to search for a concept of interest.  While humans can generate word lists for text-matching approaches, the generated word lists are likely to be limited and biased by the vocabulary, language habits, population exposure, and local dialects of the human generating the list.  Deep learning methods can help to augment candidate term lists to help overcome some of these challenges.  Once generated these augmented candidate terms are reviewed by subject matter experts for appropriateness and accuracy of the suggested terms for the concept and use case of interest.  Here we (1) query pre-trained large language models (e.g., ChatGPT or Llama) through a user interface that allows prompting (such as the OpenAI API or CodeLlama) and/or (2) query word and phrase “embedding” models (e.g., Word2Vec and Phrase2Vec) to expand candidate term lists for review by subject matter experts.  Our team has found both approaches effective for expediting the generation of more comprehensive term to concept mappings for use in text-matching algorithms that increase the accuracy of clinical concept extraction.   We expect this use of AI to improve initial brainstorming of terms related to a given concept, resulting in a more sensitive approach to finding information of interest in free-text clinical notes. ","The outputs of this use of AI is a candidate list of terms related to a concept of interest.  This candidate list is combined with suggestions generated by human experts and then these are reviewed by a subject matter expert to generate a final list of terms for use in text-matching algorithms to extract medical record free text mentions of interest. For the pre-trained Large Language model approach, the input is a query prompting for synonyms of terms related to the concept of interest.  The output is the answer provided by the LLM, including the suggested candidate terms and the original terms that were stated in the query.  For the word and phrase embedding models, the input is an initial list of terms that are relevant to the concept of interest and the output are the suggested candidate terms, ranked by their statistical similarity to the original terms, based on the transformation of a clinical corpus into vector space or an “embedding model”.  Regardless of the type of model used, all suggested candidate terms are reviewed by subject matter experts to ensure quality term lists are used in all text searches.",Operation and Maintenance,Neither,10/1/2022,10/1/2022,10/1/2022,,Developed in-house.,,No,,,No,NA,No,No,Other,The subject matter expert teams relevant to the concept of interest create the needed queries and initial term lists.,NA,"Documentation is missing or not available: No documentation exists regarding maintenance, composition, quality, or intended use of the training and evaluation data.",,,No,No – agency does not have access to source code.,,No,,Less than 6 months,Yes,,Yes,,Yes,,Re-use production level code and/or data products: This use case re-uses production level code as well as data products that have been published or made widely available for data science teams for within the agency.,"No documentation is available: No documentation detailing model performance metrics, model architecture, features and intended use of the models have been created or are currently accessible to other data science teams within the agency.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recovery Engagement and Coordination for Health – Veterans Enhanced Treatment (REACH VET) 1.0 predictive model,Department of Veterans Affairs,VA,VHA: Veterans Health Administration,Health & Medical,,None of the above.,"The REACH VET 1.0 model is a predictive model using predictors extracted from the patient’s medical records (into the VA’s Corporate Data Warehouse), such as diagnoses, prescriptions, and health care utilization, to estimate statistical risk of a suicide death in the next month.  
This predictive model is used for two purposes. (1) Primary use case is to support identification of patients at elevated statistical risk of suicide in the next month for referral to a clinical case review and outreach program. Staffing guidance to ensure each health care system is staffed to conduct the case review and outreach protocol is established per clinical policy. To date, the population recommended to the clinical case review program has been limited to a number equivalent to 0.1% of the total treated patient population at each facility each month; the number of patients in the program may be modified based on guidance from the Office of Suicide Prevention. The REACH VET 1.0 statistical risk estimates contribute to an algorithm used to identify patients to refer to this program at each facility. (2) Secondary use case is to help risk stratify patients based on prior health care interactions to support augmentation of clinical attention and interventions for patients with patterns of care associated with high suicide risk. This is used, for example, to support clinical review of relevant health care history during triage of Veteran Crisis Line calls and during risk assessment of patients in mental health care.
For use case 1, REACH VET coordinators and REACH VET providers use the list and supporting information to guide execution of the targeted prevention program. For use case 2, Veterans Crisis Line responders and VHA health care providers use the categorized risk scores in the context of curated descriptive data from the patient’s medical record to review risk factors towards optimizing assessment and clinical follow-up.   
The REACH VET 1.0 model is expected to identify a population of patients at elevated risk of suicide and other negative outcomes for review by clinicians; clinicians conduct telephone outreach to identified patients when they deem such outreach appropriate.  This model and targeted prevention in which it is used (i.e. the REACH VET program) is used to augment VHA's extensive clinical suicide prevention program. While VHA conducts universal screening for suicide risk by asking patients structured questions regarding suicidality, this screening process does not identify all patients who go on to die of  suicide. The REACH VET model is intended to identify patients who might be missed in clinical assessment or whose risk may have changed since their last assessment. Here, the REACH VET model identifies patients at statistical risk of suicide, that is they share similarities in their health care data to patients who did die of suicide in the past.  The patients at highest statistical risk are highlighted to mental health providers for additional review. This targeted prevention program has been nationally implemented in VHA health care systems since 2017 and an evaluation of the effects of the REACHVET program was conducted. This evaluation found that REACH VET implementation was associated with greater treatment engagement and new safety plan documentation and fewer mental health admissions, emergency department visits, and suicide attempts. Full findings of this program evaluation are available at:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8524305/","The REACH VET predictive model estimates the likelihood of dying of suicide in the next month for each active patient in VHA. This estimate is used as part of an algorithm that considers factors such as the size of the health care system, current patient treatment engagement, and whether the patient has had previous engagement with the REACH VET program to generate a dashboard with patients at high statistical risk of suicide for review by a REACH VET coordinator and identified clinicians at each health care system.

To reduce this risk, we provide information regarding which risk factors were identified by the predictive model to encourage transparent understanding of the basis for the model estimate.  Moreover, the clinical prevention program provides only general guidelines to clinicians indicating that identified patients should be reviewed.  This forces clinicians to rely on their clinical skills to plan intervention responses. (2) The program could be clinically inefficient and use provider time that might be more effectively focused elsewhere.  This is a real risk which may evolve over time as other components of the overall VA suicide prevention program improve, and potentially reduce the need for this targeted prevention program. VHA conducts ongoing evaluations to assess for potential inefficiencies in the model and test methods to improve clinical efficiency.  For example, VA is currently piloting a process to expand focus of the REACH VET program to patients not currently engaged in mental health care.  (3) The program could lead to unfair allocation of clinical resources if the model is biased and other clinical programming does not compensate for areas of model underperformance. This is also a risk and thus VHA evaluates model bias across key demographic populations and actively develops methods to reduce model bias or address bias by adjusting other components of the treatment system to compensate.   After review of the common risks template, the following additional risks were identified: Fair & Equitable (FE) - Algorithm target not reflective of real-world outcome of interest Response: There is a minor risk that the county coroners who assign cause of death might have miscategorized some Veteran deaths, reducing the validity of the outcome variable used.   Transparent & Explainable (TE) - Degradation of End-User Trust and Ineffective Challenge or Remedy Processes Response: This is a risk. There has been public misunderstanding of how the model performs and is used. VA has responded and clarified misconceptions in the public forums in which misunderstanding has arisen.   Accountable & Monitored (AM) - Performance Efficacy and Fairness (e.g. Model/Data Drift, Model Degradation, or inappropriate application)  Response: This is a risk, model performance is degrading over time and an update is in process. However all identified patients are clinically complex and appropriate for clinical attention.  Accountable & Monitored (AM) - User-Introduced Errors Response: There is a low risk, there is a community of practice to support proper implementation of the REACH VET Program, which is supervised and trained by national program leads.   Accountable & Monitored (AM) - System Performance Not as Intended Response: There is a low risk, the internal VA team that manages the model and risk estimates based on it has validation processes in place to review all steps of the process.",TRUE,"Intermittent and Manually Updated: A plan for monitoring the AI use case is in place, and requires data science teams to work with DevOps engineers to manually update models at scheduled intervals, and create metrics to detect data distribution shifts between the operational environment and the training data for the model. ",No - Some individual decisions or actions require direct human oversight.,,Telephone,,Yes,"VA has examined suicide risk concentration among Veterans in VHA care, stratified by patient sex, race and ethnicity.  Model performance was reasonably similar across demographic subgroups. Because the REACH VET clinical program is just one augmentative component of the overall suicide prevention program, weaknesses in the ability of the REACH VET algorithm to identify high risk patients for intervention have been considered in design of other components of the overall suicide prevention program and mitigated where possible.  For example, the REACH VET model lacks information about patients who have had minimal engagement with the health care system for suicide risk factors they may have experienced.  As such, the model will inherently underestimate risk for new patients and patients experiencing new episodes of symptoms or stressors that could elevate risk.  To combat this weakness, VA implemented a universal suicide risk screening process, including at least annual screening of all patients in primary care and mandatory suicide screening in VA emergency departments which are likely to be the entry point for patients with new challenges that are not yet documented in medical records. This screening triggers mandatory follow-up for positive cases by a clinician with mental health care training, who can offer services (as would be done in REACH VET triggered outreach).  As another example, some known risk factors for suicide were not well captured in medical records at the time of model training.  VHA has implemented clinical screening programs for some of these risk factors (e.g. military sexual trauma, food insecurity) and trained clinicians regarding their contribution to risk and the importance of offering services to address challenges.  Likewise, VA decision support systems that provide drill-in summaries of suicide related risks for REACH VET and other VHA patients (i.e. CRISTAL) summarize and display information from these clinical screeners with other information about suicide risk factors to facilitate clinical evaluation and response to suicide risks.  While it is impossible to build a REACH VET model that is not affected by biases in detection of risk factors due to variation in access to/utilization of VA health care, VHA has taken steps to address expected/known gaps in model performance through implementation of other suicide prevention programming.","[""Post-transaction customer feedback collections"",""Other"",""Public hearings or meetings""]",,Yes,,Yes,

This will decrease the nurse coordinators’ information gathering time and improving their information efficiency. Information may also help identify Veterans with diagnoses of interest for review by the coordinator allowing for additional resources to be activated to support the Veteran if they meet program criteria. 
We do not anticipate this AI to be either safety impacting or rights impacting. The output does not serve as a principal basis for a decision. Coordinators are expected to review the output and corroborate its veracity using source information obtained from the EHR. The system resides completely within approved VA IT boundaries that are fully compliant with FISMA and HIPAA rules with availability and reliability set by OI&T. The information that the algorithm uses for input and its output relates to patient and disease features related to cancer diagnoses and therefore are unlikely to perpetuate inequalities related to protected characteristics. They are unrelated to educational benefits, housing grants, loans, risk assessment for insurance, job training programs, employment services, vocational rehabilitation, or hiring. It does not impact claims and benefits processing.
While the system is envisioned to increase the efficiency of coordinators identifying information elements related the Veteran’s cancer diagnoses, these elements are not envisioned to be related to race, nor creating or promoting disparities. On the contrary, by improving coordinator efficiency, we believe the system will allow more Veterans to be supported; decreasing any existing inequities. It will also allow Coordinators be spend less time gathering information and more time interacting with Veterans, improving their ability to connect with the Veteran, learn about them, and provide Veteran-centric support, including care coordination, tracking, providing access to clinical trials if the Veteran is interested per standard of care policy set by the National Oncology Program Office, or provide other types of support. The system will make it easier for Coordinators to locate information about Veterans related to their diagnoses, however it will not be used for diagnosing disease, recommending treatment plans nor as a tool to monitor a patient’s health. It will not be used for health assessments or interventions, manage or dispense medications, or to automate labs. It will not make any decisions for the provider, but will make it easier for the provider to identify information elements of interest in the course of supporting Veterans. The system will also be entirely redundant, meaning Coordinators will still use information from the EHR to perform their workflows, both to find information about Veterans and to document their interactions. Coordinators will be able to fall back to EHR workflows should the system is unavailable for any reason.

Post discharge 30-day readmission or death prediction model to select patients for expedited postdischarge clinic follow-up.,Department of Veterans Affairs,VA,VHA: Veterans Health Administration,Health & Medical,,None of the above.,"The purpose of this AI is to act as an aid not a replacement for clinical decision-making about whether a patient should have clinical follow-up in the week following discharge (an accelerated timeframe) or follow-up in 2-4 weeks (the regular timeframe).

Patients that are predicted to have an adverse outcome will be recommended a quick follow-up but this will not be mandated, similarly patients not predicted to have an adverse outcome can still be scheduled for quick post discharge follow-up. Predicting which patients will die or be readmitted after discharge is a famously difficult unsolved clinical problem, and this tool will be one more data point for clinicians to aid but not replace clinical judgment during the discharge process.

Using Artificial Intelligence to Predict Suicide,Department of Veterans Affairs,VA,VHA: Veterans Health Administration,Health & Medical,,Searching for information using AI.,"Prevention of Veteran suicide is VHA’s top clinical priority. We use AI to identify patients with two key risk factors for death by suicide: 1) having access to a gun, and 2) having an active opioid use disorder. This project is funded by and developed with input from the Office of Suicide Prevention.

THREE REASONS KNOWING ABOUT ACCESS TO GUNS IS CRITICAL TO SUICIDE PREVENTION
First, when a person attempts suicide using a gun, the death rate is about 85%. For the most common method of attempting suicide—drug overdose—the death rate is less than 5%. Second, Veterans are more likely to own a gun and know better how to use it than other patients, so Veterans’ death rate when attempting suicide using a gun is even higher. Third, there are things clinicians can do to protect Veterans from their guns while they are suicidal, such as counselling them to give the guns or the ammunition to friends or family until they feel better.  This is always voluntary, but Veterans very often agree to it, because they see and fear the risk. 

WHY KNOWING WHICH PATIENTS HAVE ACTIVE OPIOID USE IS CRITICAL TO SUICIDE PREVENTION
Patients who die by suicide almost always have a prior history of emotional and mental health difficulties. When they die by suicide, it’s usually not due to that history, but rather because some bad life event (such as breaking up with their spouse) happens and then they have an overwhelming impulse to end their lives. 

Opioid use disorder (OUD) contributes to suicide risk in two ways. First, it makes bad life events much more common. It’s hard to keep a job or have good relationships with OUD. Second, OUD also increases impulsivity. That is, among patients who have just lost their jobs, those with OUD are more likely to have the impulse to end their lives. (Among substance use disorders, we focus on OUD because it is very common and there are good treatments available.)


WHY USE AI TO DETERMINE ACCESS TO GUNS?
The need for AI arise from how information is stored in an electronic health record. For historical reasons, when a clinician sees a patient, there are codes they can use to record what diseases (e.g., diabetes) the patient has, but there is no code for having access to a gun. VHA has considered asking all patients during intake for each visit whether they have access to a gun, but this is time consuming and can cause concern among patients about why they’re always being asked about guns. 

AI, specifically natural language processing (NLP) of clinical notes, offers another way to know which patients have guns. We have developed NLP algorithms that are very good at assessing from notes whether a patient owns or has access to a gun. But we use only notes already written by clinicians, any mention of gun access came voluntarily from the patient. However, to find this information, we need a method that can go through notes quickly, and NLP provides that method. 

WHY USE AI TO ASSESS WHETHER PATIENTS HAVE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS?
OUD is a disease, and there are disease codes available to record it. However, because there are many different states you can be in with OUD (e.g., actively using vs in rehab vs sober for years), there are over 100 possible ways to code OUD. Most clinical settings (like outpatient clinics and ERs) have short list of commonly used codes for clinicians to pick from, but that may not offer up much specificity. So most clinics will only put on their list a single code, “opioid use, unspecified” and leave off all the more specific codes. Thus, typical coding practice does not differentiate between a patient who is currently using opioids or one who is 10 years sober (and, if you live along time with OUD, it is usually because you spend much of that time sober). That differentiation is important because the increase in impulsivity with OUD is only during active opiate use.

NLP can again be useful, because descriptions of OUD in clinical notes are likely to be much more specific than the codes used","OUR INPUT, OUTPUT, AND INTENDED USER In the “Please add anything else you would like to share” box below we describe in more detail why it is necessary to use AI to find information about gun access or OUD (versus either not having the information or getting that information without using AI). We also describe how we build and test AI models to determine whether a patient has gun access or is actively using opioids. First, however, we think it is important to describe how human clinicians in VHA will use our AI.   The INPUT to our AI models is simply the notes that have already been written on patients. These only contain information volunteered by the patient. The OUTPUT of our models will be simply indicators that a patient **may** have access to a gun or **may** have an active substance use disorder, along with a presentation of the text that leads the AI algorithm to reach its conclusion.   However, the INTENDED USE of the output is that a human mental health clinician be notified about patients at risk, then read the note or notes that led to the determination that the patient was at risk. The clinician may conclude that the AI was incorrect (this occurs about 12-16% of the time with our current models) and drop the issue. Alternatively, the clinician may decide that the patient does have the risk factor and that the risk factor needs to be addressed.   There is no planned interaction between the AI and the patient, nor does the AI make any clinical decisions. Rather, it is a tool to help point clinicians to potentially critical information that they might not otherwise have been aware of.   OUR AI METHOD We begin by creating a list of common terms centered around gun access or OUD. We then pull thousands of pieces of clinical text with these terms in them, and have physicians determine whether the risk factor is present or not. (A term can be present, but the patient can still not have the risk factor in a variety of ways. It could be that “the patient’s brother has a gun” or “the patient has NO gun” or “the patient used to use Fentanyl, but quit”.) The text that has been assessed by physicians is called “labeled data”. We then give our NLP models some of the labeled data, so they can learn what positive and negative examples look like.   For each risk factor, we develop 4 non-neural AI text classification models: random forest, bagging, gradient boosting, and logistic regression with ridge penalization. We also implement two large language models, BioBERT and Bio-ClinicalBERT.   Subsequently, we test each algorithm on other data for which we have (but don’t give the algorithm) the label and ask each algorithm to produce its own labels. We then compare each algorithm’s conclusions to the physicians’ conclusions. That is how we know that our algorithms so far, will be incorrect about 12-16% of the time. Over time, we hope to improve the performance of these algorithms. For example, the large language models are relatively new additions to the AI toolkit and perform better than the non-neural models. We expect further advances over time. However, the current level of accuracy is already higher than many commonly used diagnostic tests, such as mammograms or erythrocyte sedimentation rates.

Classify clinical pathway for cancer patients,Department of Veterans Affairs,VA,VHA: Veterans Health Administration,Health & Medical,,Searching for information using AI.,"The VA National Oncology Program has invested in creating clinical pathways that guide providers to provide high quality evidence-based standard of care treatments to Veterans with cancer. However at this time, it is unclear how many or how often providers are ‘on pathway’ or are concordant with this recommendation. Work will focus on leveraging AI to assess degree of adoption of various pathways. For example:  To assess care quality across the VA in regards to genetic testing in Veterans with prostate cancer, and provide the needed information to engage in quality improvement efforts, the VA NOP proposes to develop, evaluate and implement an informatics workflow that is capable of extracting information regarding whether a Veteran with prostate cancer has been offered access to germline and somatic genetic testing. Work will follow the framework NOP developed to assess germline genetic testing in Veterans with breast cancer in response to the Advances in Mammography and Medical Options (MAMMO) for Veterans Act of 2022. Briefly, Veterans receiving care for prostate cancer in VA will be identified using electronic health information in the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, and their latest relevant clinical notes will be retrieved. Data from VistA CPRS prostate cancer pathway templates will provide a gold standard for developing and evaluating the feasibility of using an open-source generative large language model to determine whether a Veteran has been offered genetic testing according to clinical notes. Earlier work has been successful using zero-shot (or few-shot) prompt development. Model fine tuning can be considered should these approaches fail. Upon achieving acceptable accuracy, the model will then be implemented for near real time determination of access to genetic testing at scale, especially in sites where this information is not available. 
This work will allow assessment of quality of care as it relates to adherence to VA endorsed clinical pathways on genetic testing in Veterans with prostate cancer. It will also facilitate efforts for improving care delivered through identification of sites that can be supported through existing efforts such as the National Tele-oncology Office, or cancer care navigation and tracking initiatives.

"Identify cancer patients symptom burden, including symptoms supported by embedded mental health.  ",Department of Veterans Affairs,VA,VHA: Veterans Health Administration,Health & Medical,,Searching for information using AI.,"Mental Health is important for cancer patients and could be barrier for effective and timely cancer care. Approximately one-third of persons with cancer will develop a mood or anxiety disorder. Mental health of Veterans with cancer is a priority for the VA National Oncology Program. We have been tasked to develop and implement a health information technology tool that will facilitate the effectiveness and efficiency of mental health providers embedded in cancer clinics, such as the one embedded in the Oncology clinic in the Durham VA. One of the challenges he faces is to identify patients that are most likely to benefit from the intervention. We aim to use AI to extract patients’ symptom burden information including the symptoms related to mental health needs from clinical notes and surface them for the embedded mental health provider. 
National oncology program embedded mental health specialists and nurse coordinators will review the information, allowing them to efficiently identify Veterans that may benefit from additional support for symptom management or mental health. This could allow embedded mental health specialists to monitor cancer patients among veterans at a higher risk level more closely and provide the most appropriate level of care. It could also potentially help veterans have increased cancer treatment engagement and quality of care, which are essential for cancer patients’ disease prognosis.

Nediser reports QA,Department of Veterans Affairs,VA,VHA: Veterans Health Administration,Health & Medical,,None of the above.,"Nediser is a continuously trained artificial intelligence “radiology resident” that assists radiologists in drafting their reports. Using computer vision/ML, Nediser selects normal templates (for example, the knee, shoulder joint), detects absence or presence of hardware in the image, evaluate patella alignment and leg length and angle discrepancy, measure Cobb angles, and evaluate hip exams for osteoarthritis. The output is directed to a QC field in the report that the Radiologist may use. The output helps standardize reports and improve accuracy of reporting.","The system classifies arthritis grade and performs measurements which are output to a QC field in dictation software as a draft that the Radiologist may or may not incorporate into their report templates. This is similar to a Radiology resident who provides draft reports that the Attending Radiologist reviews. The system can also detect objects and landmarks to assist in making measurements and identify abnormality. The output are landmark annotations and measurements. However, these outputs are not sent to the production PACS. They are stored in a secure directory which the Radiologists can refer to and do not become part of the medical record. All original production DICOM images are deleted after processing. Nediser saves de-identified JPG images and reports (no PHI) for audit and review of system performance, and to further train the model is necessary.",Operation and Maintenance,Both,12/1/2020,12/1/2020,1/1/2021,,Developed in-house.,,No,,,No,,No,No,Yes,,"

The system uses AI/computer vision/CNNs to perform several tasks including: identify landmarks on the images to perform measurements of lengths and angles of the lower legs and spine, identifies the absence or presence of hardware, and classifies the grade of hip arthritis. Before the models were deployed in operation, their performance were evaluated with testing and validation, and performance have been published in peer reviewed scientific conferences and/or publications:   Ha, AY., Do, BH, Bartret, AL, Fang, CX, Hsiao, A., Lutz, AM, Banerjee, I., Riley, GM., Rubin, DL., Stevens, KJ, Wang, E., Wang, W., Beaulieu, CF., Hurt, B.

Automatic Extraction of Skeletal Maturity from Whole Body Pediatric Scoliosis X-rays Using Regional Proposal and Compound Scaling Convolutional Neural Networks. Scientific presentation, Virtual. IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM), December 2020.  The goal is to deploy this system VISN wide in VISN21. However, the past 3 years have been spent testing in a limited, ""shadow"" deployment. Limited = Palo Alto VA only. ""Shadow"" deployment = the system is never deployed in an autonomous workflow, requires human in the loop, and outputs of the system (annotations of measurements) are never sent back to the PACS or EHRM. Instead, the model's output is sent as text to a marge field/QC field in the Radiologist dictation software called Powerscribe. This does not go to VistA or CPRS or the patient medical record. The merge field is then used by Radiologists if they desire, imported into their draft report. They can review this output, validate visually, and agree or disagree. The program deletes original DICOM data. All annotations of the program, predictions are saved with final radiologist report for audit.  Because the AI system requires human in the loop, never sends output to the ERHM/VistA, and is an optional QC/merge field in the report draft, the technical risks are minimized. Clinically, the model performs orthopedic measurements (patella, leg lengths) and arthritis. The models are not involved in real-time decision support of clinical diseases such as stroke, lung cancer.   However, all systems have risk. We identify the key risk of the Nediser system is that there may be discrepancy between the system draft output and the final report if the Radiologist does not read the AI draft report and inadvertently saves the report.",TRUE,"Intermittent and Manually Updated: A plan for monitoring the AI use case is in place, and requires data science teams to work with DevOps engineers to manually update models at scheduled intervals, and create metrics to detect data distribution shifts between the operational environment and the training data for the model.
